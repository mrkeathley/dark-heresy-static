<p>Bio:
Born on Scintilla, a 23rd generation Gath of the Sibellus Hive, Tacitus’ life has not been void of luxury. As the first-born son in his family, Tacitus has received the best education in schooling as well as in etiquette that a family of nobility can provide. It should also be mentioned that Tacitus is the great-grandson of Marcus Gath, a former Warmaster General of the Ordo Maellus who was handpicked to assist the Tyrantine Cabal in their study of the Tyrant Star. That is where the Gath family name truly gained its fame and fortune, which still flows strong in the heart of the Sibellus Hive.</p>
<p>The Gath family is traditionally split with many children pursuing military careers while others tend to follow the path of the ecclesiarch. While there are other members of the family that have chosen other paths, it is highly discouraged and even looked down upon. Tacitus chose the path of the Cleric and like his father before him, appeared to be born for the role.</p>
<p>Not long after Tacitus took up the noble robes of a cleric, his father was requisitioned for an investigation of possible daemonic activity on Dusk. The squad found what they were looking for but everyone, including young Tacitus’ father were brutally slain. Since then, Tacitus has strenuously pursued his assigned tasks. His devotion did not go unnoticed for long. After a brief time of training, Tacitus was assigned to help quell the incoming tide of mutants that spawn in the underhives of Scintilla.</p>
<p>Tacitus discovered his skills could be put to profitable use not only against daemonic incursions but anything unnatural. During his assignment in the depths of Scintilla, Tacitus was approached by the Redemption with an offer of brotherhood and service. He gladly accepted and has taken the zeal he learned in the underbelly of the hive to all aspects of his career.</p>
<p>Tacitus is usually amiable though with a dark humor. However, if there is suspicion of mutant, witch, or daemonic activity, Tacitus’ fanaticism takes hold and his ruthless methodology takes precedence. Tacitus carries himself well and his young face hides the barely restrained wrath at his disposal. His best weapon is his voice, he is very charismatic, gathering allies quickly and foes just as fast.</p>
