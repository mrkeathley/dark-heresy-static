<p>Background:</p>
<p>Sevrius is the result of two Imperial Guard troopers getting over-excited in a foxhole after surviving a particularly vicious battle. His father, Gaius, and his mother, Jenna, were war-torn veterans and the first called out to fight on the frontlines. The first few years of his life were spent traveling with the guard, until both parents were killed fighting a distant war near the Eye of Terror. He and his parent’s dog tags were transported to the Schola orphanage on Cyrus Vulpa. During his lessons in the orphanage, he quickly learnt the hard disciplines of the Schola Progenium. Incompetence and laziness lead to harsh punishment, reduced meals and long hours of boring, boring prayer. Even though Sevrius despised the discipline, this wasn’t much of a problem, as all he had to do was apply himself to his studies and avoid attracting the attention of the instructors.</p>
<p>This didn’t last though, as once the progena began their combat training under the drill abbots; they were placed in training troops. Sevrius found that combat was more his style. One day though, at the target range, Sevrius failed a ballistics test. One of the veteran abbots teaching that day noticed the exact reason Sevrius failed and proceeded to embarrass him in front of the whole troop. The abbot spoke, “One must know his gun like he knows his own hand.” Upon saying this he smashed the butt end of the pistol on top of the hand that Sevrius was using to prop himself on the shooting block. He added, “All the learned things and philosophy taught by the Scholo all factor in the preparation of any soldier that serves the God-Emperor.” The abbot’s words rung deep in Sevrius’ mind, along with the throbbing pain from his smashed knuckles. It taught him that fusing the book learning with combat skills makes a man a better soldier.</p>
<p>Sevrius didn’t have many friends at Scholo, but he did have one. Lector was a bright young lad very similar to Sevrius but a lot more intelligent. He had helped Sevrius get through a lot of the class work that was taught at Cyrus Vulpa. In exchange, Sevrius taught Lector how to shoot many different types of the guns they used in weapons training. Lector was the only person Sevrius got close too after his parents died.</p>
<p>A few days after Sevrius’ embarrassment by the abbot, both Sevrius and Lector were standing next to a classmate as they finished up with that days practice firing ant the firing range. A freak accident happened when a gun jammed as the result of friction from an overheated barrel and caused the ammo slotted next to be loaded into the chamber to explode. The explosion blew the gun apart sending sharp high velocity shrapnel every where. Sevrius’ friend was struck several times in the face, instantly killing him.</p>
<p>At the sound of the explosion, Sevrius turned his head away from the blast, but a piece of shrapnel caught him on the side of his head. It sliced his right cheek open from ear to nose. The lose of his good friend was hard on Sevrius and a few days later, while examining the stitching on his face in a mirror, he swore that he would never get close to another person like that again. He also swore that he would gather all the instruction that he could and use it to the best of his ability for as long as he was a progena. He shouted, “The God-Emperor watches over us with his swift justice!! I will not fail at what I do for you my Emperor!!” He smashed the mirror with his fist as he finished his statement.</p>
<p>Despite applying himself to all the tasks given to him, he could not stand being punished for the shortcomings of other members of his troop. To him, it got old, fast. Sevrius decided to take what he thought were discrete steps to “motivate” the others. The tactic worked and the rest of the troop, though highly intimidated by him, began to look to Sevrius as a leader. He quickly drew the attention of the instructors, who thought that he was displaying exceptional leadership skills. Sevrius decided that it was in his best interests to keep letting them think that and found himself being bounced from one troop to another to “straighten out the slackers.”</p>
<p>When Sevrius came of age with the Scholo, it was decided that his knack for discovering tidbits of information, along with his talent with weapons would be put to best use in the ranks of the Adeptus Arbites. When his basic training was complete and his work papers served, Sevrius found that he was stuck with the investigative side of being an arbitrator. It came to no surprise to him that it was actually quite boring sifting through facts and solving puzzles. He wanted to be in the populous enforcing the law. This was a big setback for Sevrius as he found himself drinking more Recaf than was probably healthy while doing all this fact sifting.</p>
<p>After Sevrius’ initial years of being an arbitrator, Lord Marshal Goreman published an executive order that all top investigating arbites were to report to Scintilla to investigate the Magistratum’s activities. Sevrius was eventually sent to a post in Hive Taurus to help with that investigation. It was there that he witnessed the development of the Diviso Immortalis under the command of senior arbitrator Kae Drusil. Sevrius tried to get a transfer into that division 3 times but was turned down each time. He figured it had to be Drusil’s doing because he thought that Sevrius was a governmental investigator and Drusil didn’t want a snoop hanging around on his team. Sevrius never tried for a fourth.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, frustration took him, as he could not do anything to the criminals and xenos that walked freely there around the post at Hive Taurus, as he was tasked to continue sifting through paperwork. Each day he looked out the window by his desk and despised the scum that walked by on the street below. He vowed that every time he encounters scum on an investigation he would find some way of getting from them what they so loved to take from others.</p>
<p>While sifting through the mountain of data that sat on his desk everyday, Sevrius noticed a weird pattern forming in a series of brutal murders that look like the work of either a cult or xenos. Upon further review, the pattern alerted Sevrius’ attention to the ongoing case study of similar killings in the Calixian Sector logged with the Holy Ordos and the Tyrantine Cabal. The Diviso Immortalis brought in a psycher seer to get a vibe on what happened at the last site of the slaying. Before the seer could speak though, his head exploded. This mishap didn’t bode well with Sevrius’ as he lost even more confidence in psychers and in the D.I.</p>
<p>Before he was able to get any further, he was pulled from the investigation and told that he was being placed under the command of the inquisition. Upon learning this, he requisitioned weapons, a mesh vest and several clips of ammunition. He also managed to get his hands on some stimm and a pack of lho sticks for the journey to his inquisitorial training. After a brief stop off on Sepheris Secundus he completed his training with the other cell members and currently awaits his first assignment.</p>
