      <description>816.M41 It is the eve of Sanguinala as I write once again in this long forsaken journal. It has remained at my lord’s estate on Scintilla while he had me on missions of a clandestine nature which would not allow the personal transport of such a sensitive document. Much has transpired since I last wrote and praise be to the Emperor and the blessed Saint Drusus that I live to recall the events of the past two years since my last entry.</description>

      <description>GM The Chateau staff file through one by one. Chance&amp;rsquo;s questions remain the same but yield potentially useful information. The mere presence of the Inquisition is enough to loosen tongues, whether to plead innocence, accuse others of guilt, or to give wild interpretations of current events.&#xA;The stablemaster relays that he was feeding the infernal canid in the stableyard during the dinner to keep it from making a racket. Says the beast rarely rests and rages terribly when anyone gets close.</description>

      <description>Aleister (anyone who would accept a telepathic message from Aleister hears in Aleister&amp;rsquo;s voice) &amp;ldquo;Hey, Something is happening soon&amp;hellip;, not sure what but its something.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Aleister stands straight up in his chair and says &amp;quot; Everyone, something is coming this way. Take cover!&amp;quot;&#xA;Chance Immediately alert, Chance searches his senses looking for any sign of danger.&#xA;Theta Theta looks and listens, then rushes to the nearest window opening.&#xA;Servius Servius tenses up some and places both hands on the table as he looks around the room for anything out of what he considers normal.</description>

      <description>Tertius Tertius listens to Servius&amp;rsquo; open question in regards to the audio file from the future. &amp;ldquo;Stopped or killed I think the result will be the same. The audio file mentioned that we were blind to what Haarlock had really been doing. Servius did you see the vision on Mara of Haarlock spilling the blood of Xenos?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Servius I believe I did but, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say if it was real or something we just were suppose to see.</description>

      <description>Tertius Tertius looks down at the toxin burnt Quinn, his eyes death frozen in terror. He sighs, regretful of another Throne agent lost. &amp;ldquo;Saint Drusus, guide this servant of thd Emperor to his side.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He looks up at the gastly face of Herrod. &amp;ldquo;With your permission sir, may we see to his personal effects to see what might be of use?&amp;rdquo; (If given permission he will ask Thorn to see what Quinn had on him and divvy up his gear to the team)</description>

      <description>The acolytes descend in the cargo lift for what seems like an eternity before coming to a halt. They exit the lift into a vast stone cavern. The Acolytes can see an illuminated complex of prefabricated metal cabins set on risers and illuminated by a faint pool of light within an abyssal sea of darkness. The irregularly shaped cavern seems almost impossibly vast to fit into the space beneath the ice station and although the walls and ceiling cannot be seen, an impression of a limitless gulf surrounds them, and a cold, guttery wind blows through it.</description>

      <description>The acolytes are in the room with the dead bodies with a Janissairie having turned on his brother. There is a bit of uncertainty in the air about how to continue.&#xA;Tertius Tertius watches the raving Janissary get cuffed and tranquilized. Deep in though he walks over to where Servius is by the body of the man in the chair. He whispers to Servius as he starts to search the body, &amp;ldquo;Let us hope these are not our friends from the Ordo Malleus.</description>

      <description>Tertius Servius&amp;rsquo; chuckle at Aleister calls attention towards the young man. Tertius, sitting near Aleister asks him in low, concerned tones, &amp;ldquo;Sir. Is everything quite alright? You seem somewhat distressed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Aleister &amp;ldquo;I.. Uh&amp;hellip; what do you mean?&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Aleister starts becoming quite flustered and furthers avoiding eye contact.&#xA;Tertius Tertius makes a calming gesture with his hand towards Aleister (a patting motion), &amp;ldquo;Please do not be troubled sir. I apologize on Servius&amp;rsquo; behalf for his treatment of you.</description>

      <description>With the daemon freed to wander amongst the stars, the storm breaks within the city of Sinophia Manga and washes away the blood from the streets for now. Constantine musters his strength and takes over what remains of the Adeptus Arbites force, calling in his scant reinforcements Karib City and sending a distress call to his subsector command. Meetings are held and after learning of Skarmen&amp;rsquo;s infamy &amp;ndash; even if the common people never do &amp;ndash; the Undertow and the Enforcers alike rein in their forces for the time being.</description>

      <description>Tertius Tertius holsters the bolt pistol in his shoulder harness and then produces a small cleaning cloth. He busies himself with wiping away the gore from his glasses and says, &amp;ldquo;All of you stay on your guard. That corpse thrall comtinued to attack after Skarmen was deceased so whatever is empowering those abominations still remains.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He puts the less bloody glasses on, shakes the cloth out and puts it away. He then stoops down to search Skarmen&amp;rsquo;s pockets while saying to Fihad, &amp;ldquo;Marshall Constantine.</description>

      <description>Tertius examines the bodies of the thralls, both torn into two from the barrage of bullets and internal explosions, looking for clues. As he ponders what it would take such a heretical being the arbiter vox is active with details about attacks around the city.&#xA;Garbled reports start to come through of an attack on an Enforcer column moving through the commercia ambushed by an unknown force. Rapidly, things worsen: some reports claim that the Khan himself has been killed in the attack, others suggest that he is critically injured or even taken captive.</description>

      <description>Theta and Servius exit the manor by the main gates. Servius is still catching his breath from the hit he took and his quick exit. Behind some shrubs near the entrance Eupheme watches hesitantly. &amp;ldquo;Were you able to stop the attack? Are we safe?&amp;rdquo; Theta nods and heads back inside leaving Servius to rest with Eupheme.&#xA;Exploring the remainder of House Amorite is a lesson in decay. It has become an ancient pile filled with cobwebs and spoiled grandeur surrounded by an overgrown garden of weeds.</description>

      <description>A respite from the fight emerges as the final attacker falls to the floor in flames. The court is still hot from battle and the burning corpses that litter the floor. From within the halls, the panic can be heard as those left alive flee for their lives. Skarmen glances back at the Acolytes and urges, &amp;ldquo;Hurry, we must secure the Judiciary!&amp;rdquo; Tertius nods as he and Servius help Torqul to his feet and assist him out of the court and into the inner halls.</description>

      <description>Naeva You leave the Folly being careful to remain concealed as you sneak out and into the city. You make your way to the outside of District VII also known as the &amp;lsquo;Shadow Manses&amp;rsquo; but are aware as you approach that you have seen the manses dominate the skyline of the other districts. The seaward edge of District VII is protected from the worst of the elements by a sheer cliff that darkens its streets in shade.</description>

      <description>Tiber shrugs as Tertius asks about the &amp;ldquo;witch mirror&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;I have heard about similar things but don&amp;rsquo;t know much about them. Callisto, he was my old boss, he had a &amp;rsquo;truth glass&amp;rsquo; he claimed. I saw it, pretty thing, but I thought it was just a lie to fighten the dregs and other witless filth. However, word did reach me about the sacking at Worm&amp;rsquo;s End. It&amp;rsquo;s just an old canteen in district 13.</description>

I was worried we would be stuck in that graveyard for the whole week!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The motor skiff finally comes to a halt on an old wooden pier on the edge of the Commercia district. Georg and his gang disembark and beckon the acolytes to follow the group around a large building and through its massive doors.</description>

The crew, having caught wind of the team&amp;rsquo;s inquisitorial ties, has given them a wide berth and are out of ear shot.&#xA;Tertius thoroughly wipes his mouth with a cloth napkin after the less than savory meal. He clears his throat in such a way as to be a polite call for attention and says, &amp;ldquo;Torqul.</description>

      <description>After the acolytes had finished conferring amongst themselves of the next course of action, they loaded up and left the Clockwork Court. Leaving the building there is a clear sense of anxiety amongst the remaining workers. It is a palpable concern that makes it clear that nothing profitable will be accomplished today. The same feeling extends upon leaving the building. The news of the governmental attack and perhaps even the death of the Judiciary has spread faster than anyone could have anticipated.</description>

      <description>Dezner &amp;ldquo;After we finish at the crime scene, I suggest that we split into two groups. One group can take care of contacting the criminal underworld and shopping, and the other can head back to base to get Tertius fixed up and any samples analyzed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Tactitus &amp;ldquo;Tacitus agrees with Dezner. Since Servius has more experience with the investigative aspects needed, I feel he should accompany Tertius. I can tag loosely behind Dezner.</description>

      <description>In his downtime Tacitus sought to aquire ostentatious and deadly possessions, aligning with his new aggressive philosophy. Also, he began the visual metamorphosis that had already taken place within himself while on Quaddis. The Acolyte looks much different than the young man who assisted you on Acreage or the Ghost Ship. That man had the cocksure manner of a well-to-do noble accompanied with the fiery zeal of his youth. However that time has passed.</description>

      <description>The Acolytes have scored a great victory over the servants of Chaos and bested evil where it may be found. The extraordinary eclipse swiftly passes with the Widower’s bodily destruction and light once again shines on Xicarph, leaving the Acolytes amid the carnage of the great and good. It is not long before armed servitors manage to regain control of the manse from the Pilgrim’s grasp.

You have all fought for survival on multiple occasions in the past 48 hours and it creates a somber atmosphere in Septimus&amp;rsquo; small sectional.

While we could all use some rest I find myself restless.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Septimus responds, &amp;ldquo;Perhaps - although it is getting late. May I ask what you wish to seek tonight?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;As you well know, knowledge is power. There is a lot more going on here with this festival than we have a grasp on.</description>

He had just translated the former pirate raider and the accompanying Fortunatus, into warp space. The path ahead seems clear and the currents of the warp seem favorable for a swift return to Port Wander. Tybalt Gath also moves away from the ship’s helm, allowing a crewman to take his position after over 10 hours piloting.</description>

      <description>Excerpt from Private Journal of Tacitus Gath: Tacitus Gath: The Glory of Madness I have seen it now, the way of things. The God-Emperor gives us what we can take and then he gives us more without ceasing until we shatter like a chandelier smiting the ballroom floor. But He-enthroned does not leave us in this state. No, the God-Emperor reconstitutes us from the ashes of our humanity.&#xA;He makes us stronger than before.</description>

      <description>Day 1 of my first mission. The Brazen Sky. At last we have completed our training. No more grueling physical training and endless indoctrination. I must confess a mounting excitement at the prospect of venturing out on my first mission. For posterity’s sake I have decided to keep a journal to chronicle my future voyages.&#xA;Currently I am aboard the freighter “Brazen Sky”, bound for Iocanthos. Inquisitor Graves has personally assigned the group and me to investigate some strange occurrences that have be reported at the building site for a new cathedral dedicated to the great saint Drusus.</description>
