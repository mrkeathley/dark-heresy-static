        <h3 id="tertius">Tertius</h3>
<p><img src="/images/future-tertius.png" alt="Future Tertius"></p>
<p>Tertius listens to Servius&rsquo; open question in regards to the audio file from the future. &ldquo;Stopped or killed I think the result will be the same. The audio file mentioned that we were blind to what Haarlock had really been doing. Servius did you see the vision on Mara of Haarlock spilling the blood of Xenos?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius">Servius</h3>
<p>I believe I did but, it&rsquo;s hard to say if it was real or something we just were suppose to see.</p>
<h3 id="tertius-1">Tertius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I understand your, and everyone else&rsquo;s misgivings. However, the message said to consider Haarlock&rsquo;s legacy. Historically, Haarlock was a major contributer in taking the Calixis Sector for the Imperium during the Angevin Crusade. He slew Xenos and heretics alike.</p>
<p>That is all ancient history but think of what we ourselves have experienced. In orbit above Mara, Haarlock&rsquo;s ship fought enemy vessels. In the ice station he prevented our enemies from finding the Tezzeract. It was us alone that Nostromo was allowed to aid. Nostromo could have led us to our deaths at any point but he brought us safely through. The traitor Fihad and the heretics he represented considered Haarlock their enemy for he had fought their kind before during the Crusade.</p>
<p>I believe that Erasmus Haarlock, though certainly no saint, has been fighting for the Imperium all along, in his own way. Those future realities we visited were warnings from an ally. Haarlock could have brought any number of those others that sought the Tezzeract through but didn&rsquo;t for they were enemies of the Imperium. He chose us, members of the Holy Inquistion to walk his path for we are loyal servants to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="thorn">Thorn</h3>
<p>Thorn, deep in thought, ponders Tertius&rsquo; words for a long moment. Suddenly, his hand drops from the pommel of his sword. &ldquo;My orders are clear. Yet, we have fought together, nearly died together, and thus far triumphed together. I do not wish to fight with those who I have shared these moments with. I fear it shall be my ultimate undoing and do not believe this is the right path but&hellip; I stand with you Tertius. Let us get on with it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister">Aleister</h3>
<p>Aleister speaks up,  &ldquo;Tertius, I trust your judgement&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius-2">Tertius</h3>
<p>Relief washes over Tertius&rsquo; face as the affirmations from Aleister and Thorn are voiced. &ldquo;With the Saint&rsquo;s blessing we will triumph again comrade.&rdquo; He says to Thorn. &ldquo;Though, if I am wrong, we doubtless will not live long enough to have regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right hand still under his cloak, resting on a pistol grip, he turns to Herrod and what is left of his retinue. &ldquo;Inquisitor. If, upon arrival, Haarlock proves to be the villain you fear then be assured we will give our lives to end his. I count myself fortunate to have taken this journey in your company. I pray you will continue it with us.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius-1">Servius</h3>
<p>After stoically debating all he can fathom about the situation, Servius walks over to Tertius&rsquo;s group and faces Herrod. He then states out loud, &ldquo;What we have here,&hellip; is just a battle of wills. Do we kill Haarlock or not? Our orders, initially, were to do so. But, we have seen, heard and witnessed substantially different evidence during this operation. Something greater has emerged that involves the Emperor and the Imperial realm itself. I consider myself duty bound to uphold this.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius-3">Tertius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. As Servius has astutely pointed out, the knowledge we have gained about Haarlock and the Blind Tezzeract require us to adapt. Our Inquisitor has entrusted us with his own rosette. He has given us authority to carry out this mission with the ability to respond to what we would learn and encounter.&rdquo;</p>
