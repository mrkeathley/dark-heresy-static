        <p>Tiber shrugs as Tertius asks about the &ldquo;witch mirror&rdquo;. &ldquo;I have heard about similar things but don&rsquo;t know much about them. Callisto, he was my old boss, he had a &rsquo;truth glass&rsquo; he claimed. I saw it, pretty thing, but I thought it was just a lie to fighten the dregs and other witless filth. However, word did reach me about the sacking at Worm&rsquo;s End. It&rsquo;s just an old canteen in district 13. We haven&rsquo;t really cleaned it up yet. Why bother. But I can mark it on your map. I have heard that a worker named Yantra made it out and is hiding nearby but you should be able to find him if you ask around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scorn raises a hand, &ldquo;I have heard about these mirrors before. During the looting at Haarlock&rsquo;s Folly there were a number of these shards found. Two were given by the original thieves as payment to the Judiciary so they would be left alone. They are said to have been fashioned into hand mirrors so he can &rsquo;look upon what Haarlock had prized&rsquo; - whatever that means. Those nobles always have such frivolous interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tertius takes a few moments to show the court the markings with them each in turn giving a quizzical although interested looks. Hesul remarks, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen any body carvings like that before although I have known a number of our associates who like to do &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; things to bodies so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me too much.&rdquo;</p>
