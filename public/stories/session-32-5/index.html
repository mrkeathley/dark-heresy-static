    <div class="content__body">
        <h3 id="tertius">Tertius</h3>
<p>Servius&rsquo; chuckle at Aleister calls attention towards the young man. Tertius, sitting near Aleister asks him in low, concerned tones, &ldquo;Sir. Is everything quite alright? You seem somewhat distressed.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister">Aleister</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I.. Uh&hellip; what do you mean?&hellip;&rdquo; Aleister starts becoming quite flustered and furthers avoiding eye contact.</p>
<h3 id="tertius-1">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius makes a calming gesture with his hand towards Aleister (a patting motion), &ldquo;Please do not be troubled sir. I apologize on Servius&rsquo; behalf for his treatment of you. He can be rather uncouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He straightens back up in his seat and talks at a normal level. &ldquo;If by specialty you mean those of our team then the aforementioned Servius is a former Arbiter as you can see and has skills in investigation. He has also been hard at work on his calisthenics of late. Theta here is a deadly shot and excellent scout. Thorn we have only recently begun working with but is a master swordsman. I myself am a Xeno-Arcanist, a passable scholar of history, and adept at medicae and the use of technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Aleister &ldquo;And what, may I ask, do you specialize in?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister-1">Aleister</h3>
<p>Seeming to open up slightly more to Tertius&rsquo;s kindness and candor, and you think you may have seen a slight smile come across Aleister&rsquo;s face, Aleister simply respond with &ldquo;I was blessed with certain gifts and have shown quite a bit of proficiency with said&hellip;&rdquo; hopefully this works</p>
<h3 id="tertius-2">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius feels an odd sensation in his mind. It feels as if some other consciousness is trying to enter his thoughts. He instinctively resists and the feeling stops.</p>
<p>He shakes his head, which is now aching,  and looks back at Aleister, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir. I just had a troubling sensation. I believe it was an attempted psychic intrusion into my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister-2">Aleister</h3>
<p>The slight smile that may have been on Aleister&rsquo;s face is definitely not there any more.  Aleister looking down at his lap sheepishly says,  &ldquo;I.. I&hellip; I am sorry sir, I do ap-apologize I was merely trying to display one of my gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius-3">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius, clearly flustered, &ldquo;I feared enemy agents may have been aboard. I welcome the apology though I fear it will not resolve the headache I now find myself with.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="theta">Theta</h3>
<p>Theta turns her head to Aleister, and says in a cold voice &ldquo;Try to get into MY head, psyker, and i&rsquo;ll display one of my gifts.&rdquo; Then returns to eating.</p>
<h3 id="servius">Servius</h3>
<p>Servius chuckles again at the sight of confusion at the table. &ldquo;So Aleister, have you had any experience with Inquisition matters?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister-3">Aleister</h3>
<p>Aleister seems to lighten up a little at the sound of the laughter, &ldquo;Well I was only recently called upon by Inquisitor Graves, and in terms of field work this is kind of a test for me&hellip; But I have training with the Scholastica Psykana for pretty much as long as I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius-1">Servius</h3>
<p>Servius responds back to Aleister, &ldquo;Test? for you? what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="aleister-4">Aleister</h3>
<p>I look of fear shoots across Aleister&rsquo;s face&hellip; after about 20 seconds he seems to snap out of it and says quietly &ldquo;Well this will actually be my first field assignment&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius-4">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius is about to respond to Aleister but then stops, mouth slightly agape. He closes his mouth, blinks a few times and says reservedly, &ldquo;Well&hellip; I uhmm&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure the Inquisitor had his good reasons for appointing you to this mission.&rdquo; He grows quite after this, obviously deep in thought.</p>
<h3 id="thorn">Thorn</h3>
<p>Yes, I’m sure the inquisitor chose you for good reason. Let us hope your gift is more&hellip; reliable when the time arises. However, I am wary of the danger of the warp. Take heed my young companion that you do not do the job of our enemies for them.</p>
<h3 id="theta-1">Theta</h3>
<p>Theta, gracefully stands up, politely nods to the Captain, and walks out of the room.</p>
<h3 id="servius-2">Servius</h3>
<p>Servius watched Theta exit the room with puzzlement then turns back to Aleister, &ldquo;Psyker powers are not whimsical. You said it yourself that you have been dealing with the Scholastica Psykana most of your life. You maybe undisciplined - like Thorn mentioned -  but,&hellip; You will fit in with this Inquisition unit. The only thing I wonder is - are you the Emperor&rsquo;s blessing or the Emperor&rsquo;s curse?&rdquo; Servius thing proceeds to give Aleister the matter of fact militaristic &ldquo;Sergeant&rdquo; stare.</p>
<h3 id="thorn-1">Thorn</h3>
<p>Thorn downs his drink, stands, claps Aleister in the shoulder on his way out of the room.</p>
<h3 id="tertius-5">Tertius</h3>
<p>Seeing the others begin to leave brings Tertius out of his thoughts to the present. He neatly folds his napkin and places it on the table. Addressing the Captain, &ldquo;Sir. I must congratulate you on a splendid meal. I cannot recollect when I have dined so well. Before I depart I would like to request some additional aid for our venture. The sealed report provided by our inquisitor indicates that we will need to journey deep into a cave network and that there is the possibility of temporal distortions. If two servitors could be sent with us to carry ammunition, rations, traversal supplies, and a vox-caster so we may stay in communication with you that would be most excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stands and addresses the rest of the group, &ldquo;I bid you all good evening and the Saint&rsquo;s blessing upon you.&rdquo; He leaves and seeks out Theta.</p>
<h3 id="aleister-5">Aleister</h3>
<p>Aleister sits in silence as he slowly finishes his meal by himself,  he occasionally takes quick looks around the room to see who still remains</p>
<h3 id="gm">GM</h3>
<p>The dinner party is winding down as the remaining the guests finishing their food. The captain is recounting the infamous tale of the troopship Vervilix which made a forced landing on planet Mara back in 810.M41. Both Silinus and Samiel are wrapped in attention although occasionally glance at Aleister eating in relative silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;What happened in the five days before the Imperial Navy reached the transport remains largely unknown. But only a few hundred gaunt and haunted individuals survived out of the five thousand Guardsmen that set foot on Mara.&rdquo; The Captain leans in. &ldquo;I have heard that comrade turned on comrade. It was a waking nightmare&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samiel sits up. &ldquo;Quite the tale indeed. Although, not exactly the morale boost our fresh acolyte might need at the moment.&rdquo; He looks over at Aleister with a wink. &ldquo;Captain thank you for an excellent dinner. It will provide the strength we need and a warm memory to fight the upcoming cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain stands, &ldquo;Quite so. The Word has bested many enemies of the Golden Throne, and in this service she shall not fail.&rdquo;</p>
