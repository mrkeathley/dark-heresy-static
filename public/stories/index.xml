Aboard the Hazeroth-class raider “the Throat Slitter” (formerly the Zephyr)
Navigator Yorke Benetek raises wearily but successfully from the navigation station of the Slitter’s still bloody bridge. He had just translated the former pirate raider and the accompanying Fortunatus, into warp space. The path ahead seems clear and the currents of the warp seem favorable for a swift return to Port Wander. Tybalt Gath also moves away from the ship’s helm, allowing a crewman to take his position after over 10 hours piloting.</description>

      <description>Day 1 of my first mission. The Brazen Sky. At last we have completed our training. No more grueling physical training and endless indoctrination. I must confess a mounting excitement at the prospect of venturing out on my first mission. For posterity’s sake I have decided to keep a journal to chronicle my future voyages.
Currently I am aboard the freighter “Brazen Sky”, bound for Iocanthos. Inquisitor Graves has personally assigned the group and me to investigate some strange occurrences that have be reported at the building site for a new cathedral dedicated to the great saint Drusus.</description>
