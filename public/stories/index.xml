      <description>Day 1 of my first mission. The Brazen Sky. At last we have completed our training. No more grueling physical training and endless indoctrination. I must confess a mounting excitement at the prospect of venturing out on my first mission. For posterity’s sake I have decided to keep a journal to chronicle my future voyages.
Currently I am aboard the freighter “Brazen Sky”, bound for Iocanthos. Inquisitor Graves has personally assigned the group and me to investigate some strange occurrences that have be reported at the building site for a new cathedral dedicated to the great saint Drusus.</description>
