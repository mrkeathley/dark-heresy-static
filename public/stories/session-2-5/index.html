        <p>As everyone is milling around the White Scholars small home, Tacitus turns to Septimus and asks, &ldquo;Would it be agreeable with you to go back to the Libraries tonight?  While we could all use some rest I find myself restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Septimus responds, &ldquo;Perhaps - although it is getting late. May I ask what you wish to seek tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you well know, knowledge is power. There is a lot more going on here with this festival than we have a grasp on. I want to research it&rsquo;s history here on Quaddis.&rdquo; Tacitus lowers his voice to a whisper, &ldquo;There is also a thought that keeps pulling within me. We have heard from multiple sources that the great clock is the key to predicting the next revel of darkness. I cannot help surmise that there is more to this clock than just an ancient time piece. The clock, the clock, the clock. There is something up with it. What can you tell me about it? We have been told that it tells when the next festival will occur, but could it be that the clock itself causes this event to occur? Can it be sabotaged or destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tertius looks up from the basic emergency medicae book that he found in his medkit and had been pouring over since returning from his second shower and clothing cleansing of the day. &ldquo;I completely agree. This &ldquo;doomsday&rdquo; clock seems to not only be at the center of the city but the center of this conspiracy as well. Sir Dexter&rsquo;s research into the family responsible for erecting the device on this world was of great import to the late inquisitor. Continuing research on the one may light the path to understand the other. Returning to the atheneum at this time may be unproductive after the events of today. Perhaps Septimus and I could return there tomorrow and resume his research, though we might need to do so in disguise. There is much else that needs be done and it might be best for us to divide our numbers to widen our investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree Tertius, yet we must be wary of the divide and conquer mentality as well. We have much recuperating left before we will be at full health.&rdquo; I have a few aches and pains but what really is bothering me are the pieces of that deal cultist that i&rsquo;ve been pulling out of my arms after the psyker attacked us.&quot; Tacitus shows the wounds to Tertius. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t major, but still sting quite a bit. I would not have had this problem in my armor, but those filthy slavers took all of that from me, us. They have hindered the work of the God-Emperor, I look forward to reminding Vulpa of this when we meet next.&rdquo; Tacitus turns to Septimus, &ldquo;A lot of our gear has obviously been poached and sold for profit. There are 2 items of particular interest to me, a family heirloom, the mirror shield of the Gath noble line and my magisterium carapace. Where on this world would high ticket items like that end up? Do you think Papa Griss would know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tacitus looks over to the newest group member and says, &ldquo;Dezner, now that you&rsquo;ve had a proper welcome to the mayhem that is our job and lives, any second thoughts about tagging along?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Dezner Response Missing</strong></p>
<p>Tacitus chuckles, &ldquo;Dezner, no offense, but even if you came from a barren death world this place is worse. Just because something seems desirable, it does not mean it should be consumed. This place is rotten with heresy and completely void of the light of the God-Emperor. As soon as I am able I will contact a contingent of the Imperial Guard and have them subdue this faithless hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Dezner Response Missing</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t about what they can give us,&rdquo; Tacitius chides. &ldquo;Rather, we are simply vessels for the Emperor&rsquo;s voice and divine will. In our current situation, we are the God-Emperor&rsquo;s voice of truth in a den of liars, thieves, and in the company of at least one cult if not something more foul.&rdquo; Tacitus walks over to Dezner. &ldquo;I assume that the you&rsquo;ve seen the darker side of humanity on Eriksel Minor, yes? Well the darker side of humanity is in absolutely no contest with the even the lightest dangers of the Warp. My family has a history with the voices in the shadows. The things from beyond have taken an interest in my bloodline for a reason I do not know, which is one reason I would like to take advantage of the libraries here in the city tonight. I think you could make a valuable resource for the Inquisition Dezner. But I need you to understand what I am about to say so I shall speak plainly. Use your skills whether socially acceptable or not for the glory of the God-Emperor and assisting in His campaign against heretics and the terrors of the warp. Do this and you will have a home here. We are a family, though often a friction-filled one. But if you do anything to willfully harm us or our mission, I&rsquo;ll kill you. I&rsquo;ll make it quick in painless as I am able. If however, you listen to the honeyed tongues of the heretics, i&rsquo;ll burn you piece by piece and when you&rsquo;re nothing more than soot, i&rsquo;ll piss on the ashes. I say this not to threaten you, but to show you our resolve. Gain your strength tonight Dezner, i&rsquo;m sure we will have need of you when the sun rises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tacitus turns to Servius, &ldquo;Any thoughts about our missing comrades?&rdquo; Looking over to Septimus Dexter, &ldquo;Our Inquisitorial brothers Alar, a sanctioned psyker, Siskon, a tech-priest were taken in with us. Would the slavers treat them differently because of their special traits? How can we find more about them?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="septimus">Septimus</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Tacitus you have many questions of which I simply do not have sufficient information to answer. I do know that your desire for the light of the Emperor in this place is shared by me- but I am more pessimistic than you that there will be any &lsquo;subduing&rsquo;. This planet is ran by the wealthy and powerful from across the entire Calixis sector - this includes the high ranking and retired military. From the history it is clear that the planet has found a loophole to keep it at arms length from the rest of the imperium in an entirely legal way. That said, the inquisition has performed many operations here when needed and will not be thwarted this time.</p>
<p>As for your comrades and equipment- I simply do not know. I haven&rsquo;t heard your tale of escape in enough detail to give insight, but I am sure that a psyker- if discovered to be one- and a tech-priest would be of worth to the right people. Your gear might be sold - or used - but I am not sure.</p>
<p>I am worried about blatantly returning to the libraries. Especially without rest and a plan. I do have some tomes here if you are up for late night reading- otherwise I do perform best with rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feel free to decide to go anyway- try and convince Septimus- spend the night studying- etc. If you get no rest we will probably test toughness to resist fatigue during the day.</p>
<h3 id="tertius">Tertius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I must concur. Returning to the athenaeum at this late hour, especially after what just took place there, would seem counter productive. The late inquisitor thought Septimus&rsquo; research to be of great importance and so I intend to return with him on the morrow to continue that work. If he is willing that is?&rdquo; Tertius says looking over at Septimus. &ldquo;I mean to enter the location in with the two of us in disguise to attempt to avoid any further tails. Tacitus, while there I promise that I will look into everything I can find on your family as well. Our time is limited and we have much to accomplish. Leave the research to us. Finding out more about the Spider Bride and attempting to locate our allies are matters of the highest priority.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus">Tacitus</h3>
<p>Tacitus sighs, &ldquo;I can see your wisdom in this.&rdquo; He looks over to Tertius, &ldquo;I will go with the others and attempt to locate this Spider Bride, you go with Septimus in the morning if he is agreeable to this. Disguise is a good way to go from here on out I think Septimus, for your primarily.&rdquo; Tacitus addresses Dezner, &ldquo;In the morning you should probably scout the area to make sure none have tracked us here and that our group can leave unseen and undisturbed. While our numbers are split we will have to be extra careful.&rdquo; Turning back to Tertius, &ldquo;Bloodlines did seem to be of importance to the Inquisitor. We will need to find out more about the ancient Haarlock line. What is important about it? Is it tied to the festival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tacitus looks over to the White Scholar once again, &ldquo;I believe it is time to explain my unyielding fervor in this matter. As you know Septimus, Faith is the shield of the Acolyte against the terrors outside of the God-Emperor&rsquo;s benevolent grace. But just as the God-Emperor blesses us with the ability to carry on witout food and sleep, likewise is his grace sufficient for us to confront those terrors when the time comes. Are there any restricted libraries that Tertius might peruse, free from any disturbance? Lest you think me wicked, please let me explain. I come from the Noble line of Gath on Scintilla. You may have heard of my Great-grandfather, Marcus Gath, he worked with the Tyrantine Cabal of the Ordo Maellus researching the Tyrant Star. My father&rsquo;s expedition was killed on Dusk while investigating daemonic activity. It is not so much as I am interested the the malignant beings of the warp as muh as it seems they have an interest with my family. Knowledge is power and it is power I seek to thwart any who oppose the God-Emperor&rsquo;s light and justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have other things that I think we should address, but I will wait until the morning. Now Septimus, which volumes do you have here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius">Servius</h3>
<p>Servius has found a nice corner of the room to prop himself up to catch some shuteye. Every time he tries to get comfortable he can&rsquo;t drift off to sleep because of the jibber-jabber. Talk of attacking the clock, divided and conquer, worrying about the slavers and old comrades, returning to the library they just left, and procurring voxbeads has worked against his slumber. Alar, he didn&rsquo;t miss much because of the odd psyker abilities that seemed to backfire quite often. But, Siskon was a good addition to the group. He reflect back to a time when they worked together on a vault in some habblock somewhere. Getting somewhat annoyed by it all he roles over and says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re conversations are quite distracting. If you insist on having them right here amongst us, you are going to be required to make them more fascinating from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Septimus, can you tell us anymore about this spider lady? I&rsquo;m curious on why she is worthy of an assassination. I have seen that you are worthy as per the deal we just settled in the library. I&rsquo;m just wondering why she would be. If you are wondering, we were asked to take her out.&rdquo;</p>
