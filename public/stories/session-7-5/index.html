        <h3 id="dezner">Dezner</h3>
<p>&ldquo;After we finish at the crime scene, I suggest that we split into two groups. One group can take care of contacting the criminal underworld and shopping, and the other can head back to base to get Tertius fixed up and any samples analyzed.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tactitus">Tactitus</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Tacitus agrees with Dezner. Since Servius has more experience with the investigative aspects needed, I feel he should accompany Tertius. I can tag loosely behind Dezner. Eyes will be focused on me so Dezner&rsquo;s activities will be more discreet and if need be I can easily move into an assitance/bruton hurling machine if he needs backup. Also, after the supply run I want to discuss the murder scene in the nobility sector. And after all those distractions are dealt with i&rsquo;m going to have a little chat with Scarmen Andiego. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t have to be too unpleasant, but I shall follow the God-Emperor&rsquo;s desire to leave mercy aside for the sake of answers if they are not forthcoming. Servius, if you go with Dezner, I will attend with Tertius. While he is in the morgue i&rsquo;ll see if I can meet with Scarmen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius">Servius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a good idea. I need to meet with the Marshall sometime soon but about Arbites business. See what you can muster out of him without mentioning anything above basic Arbitrator relations. Pass that on to Tertius as well.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus">Tacitus</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Servius, it may be beneficial to have me ask all of our questions at once. What would you like me to address with Scarmen?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius-1">Servius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ask anything but don&rsquo;t bring up any discrepancies we&rsquo;ve noticed with the arbitrators themselves unless he brings them up himself. Tertius will know what i&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus-1">Tacitus</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh and Dezner, see if you can find me a couple of Frag, Krak, and Blind grenades each. I&rsquo;ve got a couple hundred thrones for you. (hands over thrones) These may come in handy soon enough. I&rsquo;d like to see one of those corpses prance away with a Krak lodged in his sternum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tertius, i&rsquo;m sure that Scarmen will be busy with the goings on of this morning events for some time. How about you get a thorough examination of the corpses and speak to the tech adept in the morgue. While you&rsquo;re doing that I&rsquo;ll go to the Port and send out a message to graves and see if we can acquire the services of a Psyker. On my way back I may stop and speak to some of the nobility. Then when I return, hopefully all of us can go to Scarmen, Servius seemed to have some factchecking that he wanted to do.</p>
<h3 id="tertius">Tertius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Let me give you the encrypted message to send via Astropath.&rdquo; Tertius takes out his writing kit and bears down on the conference table they are all sitting around. He quickly writes a message to Graves in the cipher used by the Inquisitor that outlines the current situation and gives all the details on the presence of the Logicians. &ldquo;Here Tacitus.&rdquo; he says while handing him the message. He stands while dabbing a cloth at his still bleeding head. &ldquo;I think I will return to the Folly now. I&rsquo;ll get one of the arbites to take me back. Stay in touch with the vox if possible. Be cautious though and speak in code. I trust all of you have been studying it in your downtime.&rdquo; With that, Tertius begins to exit the small conference room at the court they had been using.</p>
<h3 id="servius-2">Servius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very leery of using a psyker right now in the investigation. I don&rsquo;t think they are very reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus-2">Tacitus</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see how substantial the presence of Psykers is here on Sinophia. If they have an unusual amount of the warp-touched here for the planet&rsquo;s size it could be a clue as to something more insidious. It will be good to at least touch bases with them and then see if any are available to be hired for the remainder of our duration here. But Servius, i do see your point and will make sure that any Psyker is sanctioned by the Imperium.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius-1">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius turns in the doorway. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m very leery of not using a psyker to help us. Did you hear the disembodied laugh earlier and see get attacked by walking corpses? Note also the manner in which the judiciary and those with him died. I think we are dealing with a powerful psyker here and we had best take measures to counter such a threat. A sanctioned psyker could be invaluable to or work.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="servius-3">Servius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We might be dealing with something more than a rogue psyker. I&rsquo;d hate for another man to &rsquo;lose his head&rsquo; over that. Keep that in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dezner, i don&rsquo;t normally share information that gather on an investigation with anyone because I don&rsquo;t trust anyone but, I know you have some skill with distinguishing the surrounds from what is appearance and what is real. What is your take on the Arbitrators and their stationing at the Follies? To me, they are somewhat out of protocol, even in the dire straits of this planet. With Marshall Scarmen and the Adjunct Fihad in charge, the ship should be running tighter. I see sloppy work everywhere. I&rsquo;m curious if you read the situation the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Dezner, that is what I&rsquo;m getting at. They should be conducting business by what you expect - strict. My suspensions are elevated but not to the point of accusation. I have seen somethings not to my liking such as the bad protocol we witnessed when the Marshall asked Fihad about the group visiting the Quorum and other evidence of extremely poor record keeping. Also, I can&rsquo;t help asking myself why the Arbites is so understaffed here. If I weren&rsquo;t on Inquisition business, I&rsquo;d report the whole troop to the the ranking Lord Marshall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lack of funding doesn&rsquo;t make up for the lack of discipline, they serve the God Emperor and his law or they wouldn&rsquo;t be arbitrators. But I can understand your viewpoint and that is why I asked for it. I believe this investigation will lead us to a few interactions with the underworld aspect of this planet, perhaps even on this venture to get the equipment we need. I assuming you will be our go to guy when that comes about. When that happens, see if you can get their perspective of the Follies and the Arbitrators. I don&rsquo;t think I would be able to get an honest answer for that, at least not until you have a go with them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus-3">Tacitus</h3>
<p>Tacitus looks over to Tertius, &ldquo;You know the problem with corruptoin Tertius? It&rsquo;s everywhere you look, whether at the edifice of a planet such as this, the teachings of the unfaithful such as the Heron, and within ourselves if we look hard enough. It is only by Him on Earth that I stay my hand as much as I do. But you know what Tertius? I find that I no longer care to. Is it better that I send the heretical heart to the light of the God-Emperor for judgment or that I rest in the surety that his will be completed. There is no solace to be found, lest it is that those whom harbor the taint in their hearts will be purged. Do you see anything pertinent within the slate yet?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="gm">GM</h3>
<p>Enforcers and Arbiters are buzzing around the destruction like flies around a corpse. As the acolytes discuss the next course of action, they see officer&rsquo;s recording data, taking notes, and eventually collecting the bodies to be taken to the morgue. After roughly 15 minutes, Fihad returns to the room looking distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is -not- good.&rdquo; Fihad states, slightly out of breath. &ldquo;As you might expect, those who fled the scene are already beginning to spread rumors and stories about the attack. And I was just informed that the enforcers are being pulled back to perform a clampdown on expected panic and looting. My intuition says that the Enforcer General knows that the balance of power might have just shifted toward the Undertow enough for them to sieze the opportunity. This is dangerous indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pauses a moment before returning to his train of thought. &ldquo;I did find the usher for the court today and had him detained for further questioning. I can have him sent to the Folly if you would like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before anyone has a chance to answer static begins on the acolytes voxes. <em>crrrkk</em> &ldquo;Acolytes, your presence would be greatly appreciated for a debriefing of the attack. This will occur upon your arrival or in one hour at the Folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fihad nods, &ldquo;I need to get back to the Folly as well. I fear that we are going to be severely understaffed for events to come.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tacitus-4">Tacitus</h3>
<p>Tacitus looks at Tertius and sighs deeply. &ldquo;See what I mean Tertius, the corruption of man using these situations for their own benefits.&rdquo; The Cleric reaches for his vox, &ldquo;Dezner, Servius, I assume you received that message as well. And Dezner, I believe there is a push being made but i&rsquo;m not sure by whom. I think it would be best if you proceed to the slums, but see if you can convince them to not take an offensive. When Tertius and I reach Haarlock&rsquo;s Folly we will attempt to convince the Enforcer General and the Arbites to stand down. I feel that this could be a ruse much like the Festival was on Quaddis and I don&rsquo;t want us to be distracted from what is going on beneath the political currents.&rdquo; Tacitus quickly adds, &ldquo;Once both the Undertow and the Enforcers are quelled, i&rsquo;ll go speak with the nobility as they will seek revenge on their murdered peers if they are as close knit and petty as they seem. However, I believe the Enforcers and the scum must be our initial focus. Let&rsquo;s get it done gentlemen, we don&rsquo;t have time for these delays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an afterthought Tacitus continues, &ldquo;Servius, I think it would be best if you and Dezner remained aloof and unconnected with the Adeptus and Inquisition while you are in the Undertow. I don&rsquo;t think we will find many friends down there based off of their reputation. And if they are preparing for a large scale push as Scarmen and Fihad believe, do what you must to keep them cowed until Tertius and I get the Enforcers to back off.&rdquo;</p>
