        <p>Four days out from Quaddis on a rusty tramp freighter bound for Sinophia; the team finishes dinner in a deserted corner of the mess. The crew, having caught wind of the team&rsquo;s inquisitorial ties, has given them a wide berth and are out of ear shot.</p>
<p>Tertius thoroughly wipes his mouth with a cloth napkin after the less than savory meal. He clears his throat in such a way as to be a polite call for attention and says, &ldquo;Torqul. I feel as though something of an apology is in order. We have been less welcoming to you than is proper. Or latest mission was taxing and the transfer of our colleague Tacitus was unexpected (Theta, Servius, and Tertius mostly slept and kept to themselves the first 3 days on board). Now that we are better rested we will of course be more cordial. I, and I believe I can speak for Theta and Servius, would be delighted to hear whatever you feel at ease in sharing with us about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you speak, Torqul stops his beast-like eating and glares uncomfortably. Somehow you get the impression this is a sign of respect, even if it is somewhat unsettling. As soon as you finish speaking he once again wields his bent utensil and shovels food into his face. When he speaks his voice is gravelled and deep, and bits of food fall out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“No welcome was necessary, brother. Our lives are but kindling in the Imperial Fire that cleanses us all. My journey to seek out our inquisitor was unsubstantial, but in truth I am better acquainted with your service than you are with mine. Your request for information is therefore reasonable.</p>
<p>“I have been three years off world in missionary service alongside the renowned Brother Victavus. Many heretics were brought before the Emperor’s judgement between his melta and my axe. When finally the Emperor grabbed his greatest blessing and Victavus fell in glorious combat, I remembered stories I had heard of the deeds of Inquisitor Titus. Thus I sought him out to serve the Emperor as a hammer of judgment.</p>
<p>“May our deaths bring glory to the Emperor!”</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have not heard of Brother Victavus but he is surely enjoying his reward if he served the Emperor so.</p>
<p>Forgive me if this is prying, but would you perhaps be from Maccabeus Quintus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Yes, and my life was dedicated at the feet of the Saint when I was but a child.”</p>
<p>Tertius brightens,&ldquo;I knew it! Your manner of speach gave it away but I did not want to be impertinent by assuming so. It is my homeworld as well! I&rsquo;m from the capital, Arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I’m not from anywhere, to be precise. Not even from Maccabeus Quintus by birth. I was carried there by pilgrims, though they were too weak to survive.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;My condelences. The pilgrimage is physically demanding but spiritually rewarding. I hope to do the journey myself one day. It still does my heart good to meet someone from home, even if it isn&rsquo;t your birth world. I&rsquo;ve been away three years as well you see.&rdquo;</p>
