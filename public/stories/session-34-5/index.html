        <p>The acolytes descend in the cargo lift for what seems like an eternity before coming to a halt. They exit the lift into a vast stone cavern. The Acolytes can see an illuminated complex of prefabricated metal cabins set on risers and illuminated by a faint pool of light within an abyssal sea of darkness. The irregularly shaped cavern seems almost impossibly vast to fit into the space beneath the ice station and although the walls and ceiling cannot be seen, an impression of a limitless gulf surrounds them, and a cold, guttery wind blows through it. Ancient, corroded machinery and mining vehicles (long since completely dead) loom blackly in the darkness of the cavern, while the floor cracks beneath the Acolytes’ feet with gritty ice.</p>
<p>Nostromo points at the illuminated cabins and gestures excitedly shouting, “I know that place, I know that place!” and rushes off in the dark towards them.</p>
<p>The acolytes begin assessing the area and walk toward the cabins. Lumin globes set on stanchions sway slowly in the cold wind, and from within, lights still flicker and faint pulses of static can be heard. There are various signs and symbols on the building that most would recognize as being from the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p>Silinus, aiding Aleister as they walk, comes along side Tertius. &ldquo;Please lead Aleister for a moment. I think I need a moment. I wish to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="tertius">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius carefully takes Aleister&rsquo;s bandaged  arm around his shoulder to support him.</p>
<p>To Silinus, &ldquo;Is everything alright madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herrod plods on slowly and mechanically after Nostromo. His retinue in tow.</p>
<h3 id="thorn">Thorn</h3>
<p>Thorn intently scans the vast darkness around them. Searching the brooding depths for signs of threats. Idly checking that his weapons slide easily from their holsters and scabbards.</p>
<h3 id="gm">GM</h3>
<p>Theta shadows Nostromo. She wants to see where he guess and why; preferably without his knowledge. Noticing Theta and Herrod, Servius moves slowly behind them and tried to keep eyeshot of Nostromo.</p>
<p>Silinus, looking a bit weak, &ldquo;Yes, I think I need a moment to rest.&rdquo; She walks over to the wall of one of the cabins and sits down head in her hands.</p>
<p>Most of the acolytes continue forward and begin looking inside the cabins. Inside is a scene of disorder and chaos; much of the control consoles and machinery within seems to have been repaired and modified, spliced together in strange ways and additional instrumentation and clockwork apparatus obviously not part of the original machinery has been added seemingly haphazardly. The machinery is powered and intermittently ticks over, registering data on its pict-screens, the print styluses scratching in response.</p>
<p>Much of the spare wall space and other surfaces have been covered in a riot of parchment diagrams of strange mechanisms, occult diagrams, data readouts and star charts.</p>
<h3 id="tertius-1">Tertius</h3>
<p>Tertius has their Janissary escort stay with Silinus while he, Aleister, the servitors, and Thorn, escorting the mercenary Cort, enter into a larger cabin. Theta and Servius sneak off after Nostromo and the rest.</p>
<p>After looking over the odd mechanical layout, Tertius begins speaking to Thorn and Aleister, &ldquo;What do the two of you make of Navigator Nostromo&rsquo;s vanishing episodes? I am also curious on just how long the man has been here on Mara. He positively exudes Warp taint and there is little telling what his motives are.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="thorn-1">Thorn</h3>
<p>“I imagine it’s some sort of psykery. A very handy trick at that.  Perhaps we can just ask him how long he has been here? Do you think the taint of warp on him is something we should be wary of?”</p>
<h3 id="tertius-2">Tertius</h3>
<p>&ldquo;He stated that he had been here no more than two decades if memory serves. However, it seems that his connection to this planet goes beyond whatever timeframe he has given us. In some form or fashion he has been here for around three millennia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tertius stops fiddling with the machines, obviously puzzled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of this contraption. The machine spirits have been improperly used that much is clear. Do you have any sense of it&rsquo;s purpose?&rdquo;</p>
