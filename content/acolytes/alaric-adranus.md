Back Story

Alaric Adranus (Alar)

Being a sector commander’s son in the Battle Fleet Claxis defiantly had its advantages. For one, you did not have some a-hole with delusions of grandeur telling you what to do. Did that make some think that I was a spoiled brat who always got his way? Maybe so, but I never let my privileged position dishonor my father or his command.

For a solider to dishonor those in command would be to dishonor the emperor himself. Most all my life has been lived on board a star vessel of some sort, mostly battleships. My destiny was to follow in my father’s footsteps and some day command my own battleship, or so I thought.

My mother knew all along about my powers and did her best to educate me in the ways of the warp and such forbidden knowledge, but being young I did not pay much attention. When I was twelve my powers began to manifest themselves but then my mother was not around very much because of her research missions. I never knew what type of research, but I just assumed it was recon work for the fleet.

Other than my mother no one knew of my powers and I kept it that way. I did on occasion, however, use these powers quite effectively to win a few games of cards. Well, by a few I mean winning almost every night that I was not on duty.

It got to the point that had it not been for my position as the commander’s son that I’m sure I would have been jumped and then “accidentally” flushed out of the nearest air lock. Needless to say word reached my father of my off-duty activities and out of respect for him I had to stop gambling, at least for now.

Life went on as normal for the next few years, my father received his long over due promotion as commander of one of the newly commissioned Emperor-class Battleships and I was one step closer to commanding my own ship. Then, quite literally, all hell broke lose.

I remember the day as if it were yesterday. The day started out as a very exciting day for two reasons. First, my mother had just returned from one of her very lengthy research mission and secondly an inquisitor and a squadron of the mythic Grey Knights had arrived on board.

Most of the entire crew, including my father, was a bit on edge, but I knew that I had nothing to fear for I had served the emperor faithfully my entire life. As I was on my way to see my mother I received a call over the ships com to come to the bridge. When I arrived I was informed that I was to meet with the inquisitor in the commander’s quarters and as I arrived I noticed my father leaving, clearly distraught.

When I entered the inquisitor asked me to be seated and then began his questioning. He had no questions about me, which I found a bit odd, but only of my mother and her actions over the past few years. After talking to him for about fifteen minutes he indicated that we were almost done and then I felt a strange feeling come over me, much like a light breeze and then a strange looking man indicated that I was telling the truth and the questioning was over.

As I was leaving I heard the odd man, who I now know was a psyker, say to the inquisitor that there was something else he had learned that was of interest. Then I saw my mother being escorted to the room and she frantically said to me, “do not fear your powers but seek out the true power behind your abilities.” She was then shoved into the room followed by the Grey Knights.

Before I had time to process what just happened my father grabbed me by the arm and told me to hurry. We reached an escape pod and he told me to get in and get as far away from the ship as I could. “But wait,” I said. He stopped me mid-sentence and told me that I had to go. “I’m proud of you son,” and with that he shut the door. Just as I had cleared the Battleship I felt an overwhelming darkness and fear over come me and then it happened.

As I looked back I saw the huge battleship buckle in the center right were the commanders quarters where and huge shadowy flames blew out of the side of the ship. Then the worst sound I think I have ever heard came from the ship, a demonic howl that sent shock waves throughout the fleet. With that the gun fire erupted and I knew that the Grey knights had engaged. Amongst the demonic screams and the hail of gun fire I could sense the countless lives being lost to the flames.

Then when I thought things could get no worse, huge towering waves of flaming inferno began to emanate one by one from the spot where the Battleship had buckled until the entire ship was engulfed in flame. After a few minutes of these waves the flag ship carrying 23,415 souls, including my father and mother, was completely destroyed. I did not have time to morn because as soon as I landed search and rescue began. As we were shifting through the charred remains I received word that I was to meet the inquisitor aboard his ship.

How he survived I do not know, but I did as I was commanded. As I arrived in the hanger deck I noticed the Grey Knights were unpacking their gear and getting prepared for jump. In a moment of foolishness I asked one of the knights, in hopes of starting a conversation to see what happened, how he had survived? Laughter erupted from the other knights as he responded, “Dear boy why do you ask such a brazenly foolish question? A Grey Knight is made to survive, to survive and extinguish the agents of chaos.” With that he pointed to the door were the inquisitor was waiting and I proceed to the door.

I opened the door to find the inquisitor and before I could say a word he said, “I know that you have psychic abilities and you are to come with us to port wrath for delivery to the black ships.” He got up and began to walk to the door and I called out, “what happened on that ship?” He turned sharply and in a pointed voice said, “Such knowledge is forbidden and it would do you well to forget anything you saw.” I could see that going to port wrath was not a choice and so I prepared for the long journey.

It finally began to set in, my father and mother were gone and I had no idea what happened. Wells of emotions began to overcome me and the weeping became uncontrollable. With nothing to do but morn, I spent days trying to get control and to make sense of it all. After a week I finally came to terms and decided it was time to move on. . I decided the best way to honor their memory was to honor them with my life. If I am to become a Psyker, I thought, then I will faithfully serve the emperor and in doing so bring honor to my family.

After arriving at port wrath I boarded the black ships to begin the new phase of my life on Holy Terra. After my soul binding which left my voice with a slight mechanical whine, I began work with the inquisition in hopes of learning more of what transpired that horrid day and serving the emperor of course.
