Background: (some changes likely to occur) 

Tertius was the 3rd born of six in a family with deep roots in the Administratum. For as long as can be remembered the males of the Kabakes family have served as Adepts. Few of the family have ever made it beyond the lowest ranks however. Tertius’ father was one such case. He failed to advance beyond the rank of a mere Archivist even though he had worked all of his life for the Administratum. The death of Tertius’ mother during childbirth with the 6th of the children forced his father to work at such a grueling rate that it, along with the frigid weather of the planet, helped drive the man to an early grave. Tertius became instilled with a burning ambition to make something of himself after experiencing his families misfortunes. He refuses to end up dying in obscurity like his father and now climbing to a position of power is his goal.  

Tertius began his career as an Adept fairly successfully. After the death of his father Tertius became critical of some minor corruption among other Adepts. This came about partly because he blamed some of these officials for running his father’s health into the ground and also out of a desire to be noticed among the organization. He gained the attention he desired but not the results he had hoped for. His accusations earned him a quick transfer to a smaller facility in an insignificant city. His chance for advancement seemed quelled. As fate would have it Tertius ended up being in the right place at the right time. After a few months at his new station he began to notice not only the same signs of corruption he had noticed at his previous position but something even more unsettling. After nearly a year of cautiously observing his peers he found that many of them were actually members of a heretical sect. At great personal risk Tertius contacted the Adeptus Arbites stationed on the world and turned in detailed accounts of his findings. It turned out that the Arbitrators had been investigating this particular sect for some time but had been unable to find enough evidence to make a move against them. Tertius’ report led to 11 of his fellow Adepts being incarcerated. The subsequent interrogations revealed that this sect was further developed than had been expected and was actually a large enough threat to draw the attention of the Inquisition. Tertius was called in during the trials to bear witness and present further evidence. The Inquisitor that was present for the proceedings was impressed enough with Tertius’ thorough findings on the sect and his willingness to turn in his own colleagues that he ended up offering Tertius an invitation to join his retinue. Though the Inquisition had never been a career he had dreamed he would be a part of Tertius released that this was the chance for advancement he had long hoped for and thus eagerly accepted his new position.

Tertius is a slender young man with shoulder length light brown hair which he generally keeps in a pony tail. He has light green eyes and pale skin. His career as an Adept has not required much in the way of physical exertion and therefore his musculature leaves much to be desired. He is generally amiable amongst friends and strangers and does well at blending into whatever social environment he finds himself in. A certain shrewdness lies behind this friendly demeanor as his outgoing attitude is a tool he uses to seek ways of advancing his goals. His ambitious mindset makes him a ready leader since he knows that a position of authority is a sure way to gain recognition and promotion. Years spent within the Administratum have made him patient and cautious. Rash and unresearched responses are not his preferred style of approach to complex situations.

Tertius was raised in a home that had something of an above average faith in the God Emperor. His own personal experiences have made him less zealous than his father or mother raised him but he still has his faith. The reasons for his actions against the heretical Adepts was more for himself than for the good of the Empire. His deeds as an acolyte in the Inquisition follow the same line of reasoning for him. Persecuting the enemies of the Imperium is the best option he has open to him for attaining power and authority. He carefully disguises this desire for self promotion as best he can with pious talk of his zeal for the Emperor but his heart is not fully behind his words.
