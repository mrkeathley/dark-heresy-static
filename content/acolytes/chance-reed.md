Back Story:

Chance spent a decade on the Rogue Trade ship The Harlan serving as a pilot and attendant to various officers. Having won his way aboard the ship in a dice game he had to work extra hard to earn the respect of the rest of the ships crew. He did with his quick wit, charm, and decisiveness. His prowess with his sidearms didn't hurt either. Having spent time on many different worlds engaging in trade, combat, and other sensitive negotiations Chance has a diverse view of the world including Xenos.

He relishes games of chance and isnt afraid to 'roll the dice' both in life and for sport. At times both daring and reckless one thing is for sure, he has no problem taking action rather than becoming a victim. Warm, friendly, discerning, but with a certain edge his name turned out to be prophetic.

A gambler and smooth talker in equal doses, Chance is ambitious and pursues the finer things in life. Born into a pleasantly obscure noble family he won his way into a Rogue Trader Fleet in a game of ... chance. After seeing the freedom, autonomy, and opulence of the Rogue Trader he served under he knew what he wanted. To be a Rogue Trader of his own. A chance opportunity provided him with what he sees as his best path to that goal: service in the inquisition. Hopefully, should his luck hold up he can earn his own warrant of trade and with it untold riches!
