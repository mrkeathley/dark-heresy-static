Background:

Born on a Demesne world in service to the Omnissiah, Siskon’s family had always known service and servitude. Youngest of a family of nine, he and his ancestors had always known slavery to the Omnissiah and the Machine God. He lived his life for the first seven years in a city of slaves in which hunger, disease, violence, and depravity ruled as the norm. With his own eyes he watched his mother ravaged by leprosy, her limbs gradually choked and fallen off. His father and brothers worked as slaves, and his sisters worked as prostitutes on the street. One day, his sister ran to the door breathless and bleeding from several hard blows to her face, screaming for help. Behind her, a brute of a man ran laughing and calling for his prize. Siskon’s brothers and father shut the door on him, and the man promised vengeance. That night, the man returned with his gang and set fire to the house, surrounding it and savagely shooting their primitive guns in a sporting manner to determine who could get the most shots into his victim before he or she died. As Siskon ran from the house, he stopped short with the image of his father’s chest exploding from an energy blast of a las pistol burning forever into his mind. As the murderous mob turned their guns on him, he heard faintly a ghost of a whisper and the guns all jammed. Siskon ran up the street straight into the arms of a Magos Militant who was inspecting the slave world for conscripts. From that day forwards, Siskon was pressed into the service of the Disciples of Sollex in the Lathe System who recognized his connection to the machine spirits.

Siskon buried himself in his service to the Machine God, determining never to allow his weak flesh to hinder him. Having witnessed the frailty of the flesh in his own family, his ambition drove him towards the power of machines and the lost mysteries of the Dark Age of Technology. Inducted into the Cult Omnissiah, he studied to augment his knowledge of warfare and technology; so that he would never again be at the mercy of anyone. From the beginning, he displayed a remarkable aptitude towards warfare and the weapons of the Cult Omnissiah, and his masters trained him in the ways of Sollex. He developed a love for technology and an ardent passion to serve the Machine God. As his studies progressed, he began to detect a certain weakness in his masters. During the course of the next fifteen years, he followed this weakness, endeavoring to trace its source. To his horror, he discovered that they doubted the Machine God and the Emperor-God who kept technology alive in the universe. The next night, he planted charges in the building to eradicate these tech-heretics from the planet. As fate would have it, the Inquisitor arrived the next day to question these heretics only to discover the burning remnants of the building and Siskon watching his handiwork.

Siskon is above average height at six feet, two inches but thin and wiry instead of bulky. His black hair is cut short in military fashion where it is visible under the metal housing bolted onto his skull. He has sworn off the frailties of the flesh in favor of the cold, calculating nature of a machine, even to the point of staining patches of his skin metallic along his forearms and face which are most visible. The rest of his skin is pale, and he has covered his eyes with red lenses to obtain more of an appearance of the machine. His lower face is covered with a network of grilles and tubing that runs back up under his robe to the slight bulge on his back. On either hand is a blue, electoo tattoo covering the entire back of his hand. His right index finger also has a small, blue electoo on the tip.

His personality is cold and aloof. He cares little for the uninitiated in the wonders of technology and nothing at all for those who do not use technology. A bit of a show-off, he delights in displaying the wonder of the Machine God and his own prowess in the use of technology. Due to his past, he burns with an inward fury against those who would forsake the path of the Omnissiah to return to frail flesh. His desire is to grow closer to the Machine God and purify the universe of any and all beings who have deviated from the path of the Omnissiah, using any means at his disposal to that end.
