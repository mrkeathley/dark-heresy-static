### Tertius
Tertius holsters the bolt pistol in his shoulder harness and then produces a small cleaning cloth. He busies himself with wiping away the gore from his glasses and says, "All of you stay on your guard. That corpse thrall comtinued to attack after Skarmen was deceased so whatever is empowering those abominations still remains."

He puts the less bloody glasses on,  shakes the cloth out and puts it away. He then stoops down to search Skarmen's pockets while saying to Fihad, "Marshall Constantine. You are in charge of the Adeptus Aribites on Sinophia now. This is not the way you envisioned coming upon such a promotion I should think."

### Servius
"Do we need to regroup and search the rest of the building? I agree with Tertius. We've only secured the first floor of the Folly."

### GM
The entry chamber is filled with the smoke of gunfire and explosives. The shattered furniture is charred and splattered with blood. The bodies of the Arbites forces, both warp tainted foe and friend lie on the ground. Arkadia lies unconscious against the wall, blood pooling underneath her as she struggles through labored breaths.

Fihad releases the tenseness from his shoulders as the battle adrenaline rush begins to subside. "This day has been anything but what I envisioned. There are many of my Arbites unaccounted, so I wish to search the Folly as quickly as we can."

### Tertius
"Certainly Marshall." Tertius says to Fihad. "The mechanism by which Skarmen raised and used the dead must be here and must be found."

After taking several items from Skarmen's pockets, Tertius rises and speaks loudly across the room to Thorn, "Thorn. What is Arkadia's condition?"

### Theta
Theta does a sweep of the remainder of the first floor then goes to the stairs to listen and shoot anyone who comes down. 

### Thorn
Thorn quickly begins checking Arkadia's vitals trying to identify the extent of her wounds.

### Servius
Servius walks over to Arkadia & Thorn to see if he can lend a hand with Arkadia.

### GM
The blood pool beneath Arkadia spreads as Thorn lifts her unconscious head. "Arkadia, can you hear me?" he asks, becoming aware that one of her broken ribs jutting out the rear of her armor is the source of the blood flow. Arkadia's face is tinted blue as her breathing slows and then stops in his arms.

(Theta there are no stairs. There is an elevator that goes to the 1st and  2nd floor. And a separate elevator that goes to the cellar. You would remember that the 1st floor had the bunks, dormitories, and arms vault. The 2nd floor contained the offices and private chambers. The cellar contained the holding cells, interrogation rooms, cold stores, and mortuary.)

### Tertius
Tertius, looking across the room at Thorn holding Arkadia, now sees the growing pool of blood. He rushes over, throws his pack down and removes his medkit.
