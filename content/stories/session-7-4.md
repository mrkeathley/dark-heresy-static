In his downtime Tacitus sought to aquire ostentatious and deadly possessions, aligning with his new aggressive philosophy.  Also, he began the visual metamorphosis that had already taken place within himself while on Quaddis.  The Acolyte looks much different than the young man who assisted you on Acreage or the Ghost Ship.  That man had the cocksure manner of a well-to-do noble accompanied with the fiery zeal of his youth.  However that time has passed.  His face which still ardently clings to his teenage years is heavily lined, not with marks of age but callous scars caused by extensive exposure to the corruption that he vigilantly opposes.  Tacitus now keeps his blond hair shaven to a low stubble, highlighting the intense scarring he has received.  

The scarring coupled with his young face is very disturbing for most to behold, which is why he now wears a jet black mask fashioned in the likeness of skull with golden flames licking up around the bottom and the Imperial Aquila embossed in gold on the forehead.  The cleric has exchanged his billowing Ecclesiarchy robes with the exception of the hood in favor for a more functional military style wardrobe.  The collection of black fatigues, leather straps, weapon holsters, and buckles are adorned with hundreds of golden symbols of both the Imperium of Man and the Adeptus Ministorum.  

His demeanor is quiet and his grey eyes cold as iron.  Where once people would seek him out, they now avert their gaze.  Most are wary of him and keep a distance lest they come under the cold eyes that pierce flesh, exposing the corruption within.  Rumors are spread amongst the noble houses and among initiates of the Ecclesiarchy about where Tacitus Gath has been this past year, what caused his sudden reappearance, but mostly they discuss what changed the boy from Hive Tarsis.  The rumors, like they often do, range from laughably false to eerily accurate.  What they do have in common is that the end product, the zealous man in black and gold, is utterly mad and sees himself as a cleansing flame with no regard for excuses or collateral damage.
