### GM
The Chateau staff file through one by one. Chance's questions remain the same but yield potentially useful information. The mere presence of the Inquisition is enough to loosen tongues, whether to plead innocence, accuse others of guilt, or to give wild interpretations of current events.

The stablemaster relays that he was feeding the infernal canid in the stableyard during the dinner to keep it from making a racket. Says the beast rarely rests and rages terribly when anyone gets close. Never seen anything like it in an animal.

One young valet says that he heard from a cousin who lives in the farming country that Le Bete de la Nuit flies through the nights sky with terrible howls and shrieks.

Several other wild theories are thrown out. Several say it is the mutants of the town of Mandagout that come out to feed on pure humans during the nights. Some that it is the feral canids, that they grow to hulking sizes and carry off people to hidden lairs for later consumption. The older women of the cooking staff all swear it is the Homme d'Ombre of legend, returned to steal away the impious.

All of you, minus Aleister due to his watching with his psy-sense, notice that your interviewees always give honor to the Cardinala when they enter and are more nervous towards her than they are towards the Inquisition.

To Aleister, the young chambermaid Patrice bears a faint warp scent. It  could be likened to a single smudge on window glass. On some worlds, like the cursed world of Dusk, this amount of warp touch or even more so would be commonplace. Here, Aleister is coming to realize, the influence of the warp is nearly non-existent.

Patrice answers that she was carrying out her duties tonight of helping Lady Moselle dress for the dinner and then began to prepare rooms for the evening. She nervously waits in front of you for more questions or to be sent away.

At the newly erected judges table it is decided that Father Pascal and Moselle should be brought in for questioning. The Duc stands. "Inquisitor. May we speak privately a moment? Please continue your examination." He says cordially to the rest of you and the Cardinala. "The Father is in the next room. Lamar will have him fetched for you when you desire."

Servius continues questioning Patrice for the moment. She responds meekly, "Nearly three years now Lord Inquisitor. I have been her regular attendant for at least two years."

Graves and the Duc move to the far side of the large library out of easy earshot. 

### Servius
Servius responds back to Patrice, "Thank you. One other quick question - have you noticed anything odd about Madame Moselle or any others around her lately? Anything out of the normal activates of the daily routine?"

### Theta
Theta leaves the room after Aleister's discussion with her.

### GM
"No Inquisitor. I mean, Lord Inquisitor. I have not seen anything unusual. We all are afraid of Le Bete de la Nuit of course but nothing other than that."

Other than what Aleister noticed, there doesn't seem anything else of note with the young woman. Servius feels like there is something more but can't put his finger on it. At any rate, he can't think of any other pertinent questions at the moment and decides to allow her to leave.

(This is one of the moments when, because you failed a roll with a difficulty modifier on it, you know out of game you missed something. In game though you will have to wait for another opportunity to investigate her or re-examine that lead if the trail grows cold.)

Captain Duhamel enters as Patrice leaves and approaches Lamar. "We've searched every nook and cranny of the house and the grounds and we've found nothing. I've doubled the guard on the perimeter and have set up roving patrols. Any results with the servant staff?" The large man asks the group.

### Aleister
You each hear a message come across your minds "Please try to either be close together or let me know where you are,  I am getting a bit of interference from all of you.  Especially you, Lord Inquisitor(only Graves hears this part). When you are spread apart I keep getting blips for warp touched due to our merry band having dealt with Warp Anomalies in the past.  So please try not to stray to far (only Theta hears this part)"

Aleister calls out when Patrice is about to leave the room but not directed towards her "Is there any way I could get some sort of hot tea? * cough cough* Preferably herbal of some sort maybe with a bit of honey,  this blasted cough is killing me"

### GM
"It's the nights mist." Lamar says to Aleister. "They can bring about a fretful cough." He calls for tea for you. Aleister detects nothing from Duhamel or others in the room but realizes that all of his sending mind messages and asking for tea has interrupted his pysiniscience focus. He will have to focus again when anyone else enters the room.

Graves and the Duc return to the table. Captain Duhamel relays what he said above again.

The Duc turns to the Inquisitor after talking more with Duhamel. "Nothing on the grounds Graves. The men will keep watch but if there was an intruder I'm confident they would have been found."

He has a guard enter and orders him to bring Moselle in to assist you all with the questioning.

"When Moselle arrives we can continue. Who would you like to examine next?" He says to Servius, Graves, and Chance. 

### Graves

"The order is not critical although I would like to go in the order of importance in your house so that they might return to their regular duties as quickly as possible."

### GM

"Let's begin with Father Pascal then as he will want to return back to his parsonage. Ah! Moselle mon cheri. Come sit with us and assist us as we continue asking questions about the disturbance."

Moselle, now in a less formal evening dress, takes a seat by her brother. Graves and the Duc sit as well, Tyburn taking note of Theta's absence. 

Father Pascal enters and stands before the group. Young for his position but he looks weary despite his relative youth. He awaits your questions.

### Servius
Servius starts with the first question - "Father Pascal, I'm sorry for the "avian" comment I made earlier. It was a joke for my fellow acolyte that he didn't seemed to get. How long have you been in service here at the Chateau?"

### Aleister
Everyone in our group but Theta who isnt in the room hears in their heads "Pascal is clean but Moselle is a completely different story, I am reading more from than even you Sir Graves"

### GM
The young priest thanks you for your apology and indicates he has been the head of the parish since the old priest died of natural causes 2 years ago. He looks over at Aleister by the fire on occasion, uncomfortable with the sight of the psyker.

### Servius
Servius continues the questioning, "While we were at the dinner table earlier, before my comment and the commotion that followed, you mention you dabbled in biologis. How extensive is your study of that subject?"

### GM
"As I said before, it is more of a hobby. My priestly duties keep me busy but I do enjoy examining the fauna of the planet."

The Duc chimes in and says to Servius, "He is being modest. Father Pascal knows a great deal about the animal life of Elros."

### Servius
Servius grins. "Interesting. You do have an air of eruditeness about you."

Still grinning after a very brief pause, Servius continues, "At the dinner table, Do you remember mentioning the "feral" canid on the compound?"

### GM
"Of course. It is at the stables if you wish to see it for yourselves. It has some issue of distemper I cannot account for."

### Servius
Servius curiously inquires, "Distemper? What do you mean?" "I have not 'seen' the creature yet but, I hope you can expound on that?"

### GM
"Terrible rages. Far beyond the normal state of the creatures."

### Servius
"Is it curable?"

### GM
"Not that I have been able to discover. Even if rested and well fed the canid still is unapproachable."

### Servius
"Any idea what may have caused this 'unapproachable' state?"

### GM
"A mutation perhaps? I don't know of a natural reason this could happen. It is not suffering from any disease I know of. It is quite healthy, even stronger than a regular canid but far more aggressive."

### Servius
Servius offers a questioning response, "Hmm..., a mutation? Sounds like you think this might be more 'unnatural' than what you're used to. Have you shared any of this with anyone else here?"

"I defiantly need to look at this 'canid' when I get the chance."

### GM
"Certainly I've shared it. It has been much discussed since some believe feral canids to be responsible for the attacks."

### Servius
"Ah yes, the 'Le Bete de la Nuit' idea. What is you take on that notion? If you don't mind sharing?"

### GM
"There have been reports of canid packs attacking people in the last few months. If they are all like our one here at the Chateau then they are at least partly responsible for the deaths I'm sure. Of course that doesn't explain why people have disappeared, whole families vanishing from their homes. Many a peasant believe that the canids grow into a human like form during the middle of the nights and take people to their hidden lairs to be devoured later. It is foolishness of course. No animal on Elros changes form in such a way. But as I said, I do think the feral canid packs are partly to blame. Beyond that, only the Emperor knows."

The priest looks tired and this prompts the Duc to speak up. "Honored guests." He says addressing you all and the Cardinala. "The hour is late, the clock closes in on the 10th hand. To speak plainly I do not believe questioning my houseguard will yield any new information. They are men hand picked by Captain Duhamel and their loyalty is unimpeachable. Would you like to adjorn for the evening and resume after breakfast? We can give you a more thorough briefing of the current situation at that time as well."

### Servius
"Is there any evidence of an attack?"

### GM
The Duc responds to Servius, "Yes. Attacks and disappearances almost beyond number." He looks as if he is hitting the wall as well. "We have a great deal ready to share with you but I would like to do so better rested and with a warm breakfast in my belly." He says, smiling warmly despite his weariness.

### Servius
Looking back at the Duc, Servius asks, "Are their any records keep about these attacks that we can sort out?" 

"If so, I'll be glad to peruse them."

### GM
"We planned to brief you on all of that tomorrow but if you want to look through the reports tonight then by all means." He motions to the Captain who walks out of the room and sends for them.

He stands, as does his family and the Cardinala.

A clerk brings the reports in. Then another clerk brings more. Then another. Before Servius knows it he has piles of reports on the table in front of him.

### Servius
Servius thanks the Duc for the documents and Father Pascal for his information.
