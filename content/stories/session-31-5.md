With the daemon freed to wander amongst the stars, the storm breaks within the city of Sinophia Manga and washes away the blood from the streets for now. Constantine musters his strength and takes over what remains of the Adeptus Arbites force, calling in his scant reinforcements Karib City and sending a distress call to his subsector command. Meetings are held and after learning of Skarmen's infamy -- even if the common people never do -- the Undertow and the Enforcers alike rein in their forces for the time being. There is a strenuous peace again -- but a peace none the less.

The acolytes put together a report and send a call to Inquisitor Graves for their retrieval from the planet. They tend to their wounds and help clear the debris from the folly while they wait for evac.

It is made known a few days later that Xiabius Khan yet lives, although from reports he is now a wrecked man, broken in body and spirit. The acolytes see this first hand before they leave during a ceremony of gratitude for their services to Sinophia before a closed session of the newly restored Quorum. The awards are presented with some delight by the smiling new Judiciary, the honored Cal Sur'Maywroth. They receive ceremonial golden maces and the Sinophian Bloodlaurel, a special commendation medal that is the highest that Sinophia has to offer.

The Acolytes receive word that their rest will be short-lived. Their report about the planet Mara has only confirmed what Inquistor Graves and Marr had suspected. More information is planned to be acquired in person on the Inquisitorial transport that is set to take them to rendevous with the cruiser, Sigillite's Ward. 

### Servius
Servius is smoking a Lho stick and is open for conversation while we wait for the ride and do any final preparations.

### GM
Fihad sends a message to the acolytes asking to have a meal as a farewell during their final night on Sinophia. They return to their favorite restaurant in the commercia district. The stew has a way of cutting through the chill from the rain outside. You all notice the whispers of the waitstaff as you return. Being central to the main news of town has caused a bit of fame.

Constantine leans back with a drink in his hand. "I just want to say thank you for your assistance. I was not sure if the Inquisition would head my concerns but it turned out to be critical that you did. I do not believe I would be alive today if you had not arrived. A toast -- to the Emperor and his holy Inquisition!" He extends his mug squarely into the table with a smile, a new but welcome expression.

### Tertius
Though weary from non-stop research and other business post the battle in the Folly; Tertius manages a warm grin to Fihad's heartfelt thanks. "Bless you Fihad. It was but our duty. I shall heartily join the toast of such a stalwart servant of the Emperor however." He lifts his mug of hot recaf (coffee) carefully in front of him.

### Servius
Servius lifts his cup to the toast as well. "Hear, hear!" He looks at Fihad and asks, "Do you have a plan on getting the Adeptus back in order here at Sinophia Magna?"

### Tertius
The other acolytes bring their glasses back for a drink after joining Fihad's toast. Tertius looks over to Servius. "Don't trouble the Marshall with such taxing matters tonight friend Servius. Fihad will do admirably in his duties to the Arbites I have no doubt."

Looking back to Fihad, "Your service to us here was invaluable Fihad. I will mention you most favorably in my report to our inquisitor and I feel certain our Ordo Hereticus colleagues will to their master as well." He casts a meaningful glance over to Thorn, clearly waiting for verbal affirmation they will turn in a good report as well.

### Servius
Looking over to Tertius, Servius adds, "My, you're feeling rather festive. I hope you'll take that with to our next assignment." He chuckles a bit before taking a second sip from his toast glass and then shines a big grin after he takes a long drag on the lho stick.

### Tertius
"Festive? Perhaps I am though elated may be more accurate. Let us hope Inquisitor Graves feels the same when he reads my report (going to write that tonight Matt). He can be a difficult man to please as I am sure you remember."

He takes a cautious sip of the still too hot recaf. "I've been meaning to inquire: what was the weapon Thorn gave you from the late Arkadia? Emperor preserve her soul."

### Thorn
At the mention of Arkadia’s name, Thorn looks up from his glass and seems to suddenly remember he is in a room surrounding by celebrating people. He seems to take it all in, in a measured and analytic way. After a brief pause he downs his drink and resolutely sets his mug down. Seeming to make up his mind about something and then settles back into his chair.

### Servius
Not noticing Thorn's reaction, Servius responds, "Yes. It is an exquisite weapon - an Angelus Bolt carbine. I wish I could have seen her use this weapon. May her soul continue on in the Emperor's Battle."

### Tertius
Servius tells him about the gun while he attempts a sip. His surprise causes a slight but painful spill on his hand. "Throne that smarts!" He sits the mug down and wipes his hand with a tablecloth. "Bless me, an Angelus bolter? I've never laid eyes on that particular pattern but I understand it is particularly vicious in the right hands. Have you taken time to train with it the last few days?"

### Servius
"Not of late. Maybe one day in the future or... it might be good for a trade to something better. But, for now, I'll keep it to honor the fallen acolyte."

### Tertius
"You befuddle me once again Servius." He leans to his left where Servius is seated and whispers, "You may want to consider returning that bolter to Thorn if you do not intend on using it. I should not want to risk insulting the man by treating the gift of such an heirloom so lightly."

Tertius straightens back up in his chair and turns his attention to Thorn. "Thorn sir. I have not yet adequately expressed my gratitude for your superlative bladework the other day. I have never seen such an artist with the sword before. Tell me, if you are willing, how did you become such an expert swordsman?"

### Thorn
“Praise be the Emperor that we were able to thwart the evil activities here. Unfortunately, the acquisition of my skills have come at great cost and many lost companions along the way. May Arkadia Rest In Peace. “

### Tertius
"I am sure she is under the Emperor's protection now. My apologies that my query brought up painful thoughts of those you have lost."

### Thorn
“Do not trouble yourself... this is the price we all pay to serve the Emperor. May his glory endure. Besides we will exact retribution 1000 fold.”

### Servius
Servius is inconspicuously smug to Tertius's remark but, listens in to what Thorn might say to Tertius's comment. He wonder's what Thorn is holding back by being so vague...
