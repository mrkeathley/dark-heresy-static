The man spins and with a pommel strike of the sword knock the shotgun free from Theta's grip sending it flying till it slides across the cement roof into a corner.

Theta turns to known down the opponent.

Theta and the man began grappling with neither one immediately gaining the upper hand. Theta reels back during a particularly aggressive move and notices an opening thinking that she is about to be struck with the blade. Instead he does a suboptimal attack with the pommel of the blade.

The man attempts a strike against the head but misses by mere inches. Theta without a weapon backs up ever slightly and gages the next move.
