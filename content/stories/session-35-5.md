### Tertius
Tertius looks down at the toxin burnt Quinn, his eyes death frozen in terror. He sighs, regretful of another Throne agent lost. "Saint Drusus, guide this servant of thd Emperor to his side."

He looks up at the gastly face of Herrod. "With your permission sir, may we see to his personal effects to see what might be of use?" (If given permission he will ask Thorn to see what Quinn had on him and divvy up his gear to the team)

"Theta. Is the skyeye scan complete?"

"Servius. Can you talk to our Kort and apologize to him about the death of his friends. Diplomacy was not an option given our tactical advantage. Also, find out from him how many more of his friends does he believe are still alive and if there were anymore in his group like that xeno fiend?"

Tertius starts to examine his newly acquired dataslate. 

### Aleister
Aleister asks "So what just happened?"

### Servius
Servius responds back to Aleister, "You survived."

Servius "diplomatically" relays to Kort what Tertius asked.

### Aleister
Aleister says "There seems to be a slightly less bright shine I can sense in the warp, did something happen to someone"

### Servius
Servius replies to Aleister. "The 'worms' dissolved one of the Herrod's acolytes."

### Aleister
"Worms?"

### Servius
Servius answers, "Yep. some alien like creature that looked like a bunch of toxic worms." Servius returns to questioning Kort about how many more mercenaries we might face and if there are any more "Xeno-like" individuals.

### Aleister
"Would it be best if we found a way to contact off world and waited to get reinforcements?"

### Servius
Servius breaks from Kort a quick second  to respond to Aleister, "I think we're in too deep for reinforcements. But, you survived this. We should be good."
