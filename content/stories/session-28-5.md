Theta and Servius exit the manor by the main gates. Servius is still catching his breath from the hit he took and his quick exit. Behind some shrubs near the entrance Eupheme watches hesitantly. "Were you able to stop the attack? Are we safe?" Theta nods and heads back inside leaving Servius to rest with Eupheme.

Exploring the remainder of House Amorite is a lesson in decay. It has become an ancient pile filled with cobwebs and spoiled grandeur surrounded by an overgrown garden of weeds. Everything looks ill-maintained or long forgotten. The only room that appears lived in is the great room where the body of Lady Amorite still lies amongst the corpses of her attackers. Theta finds a balcony and rests her sniper on the railing scanning the area.
