The universe is a dangerous place- your retinue has experienced this first hand on multiple occasions. But this particular experience has begun to take it's toll. You have all fought for survival on multiple occasions in the past 48 hours and it creates a somber atmosphere in Septimus' small sectional. Dezner and Tertius manage to carry in the wounded and see to their immediate needs but eventually what is required is simple rest.

From a small wooden table across the room Septimus and Dulandra are discussing the current situation when the acolytes arrive. Septimus is trying to fill Dulandra in with the little knowledge he knows and put her rather skittish stance at ease but this is not easy with the wounded arriving. Luckily his demeanor, strength, and possibly age are able to calm her fears for the moment at least. The discussion is hushed however and not the focus for the rest of the group.

There is going to be few hours before Tacitus and Servius awaken. Dezner you are rather exhausted and might benefit from resting with the others- but if you feel that there is something with a higher priority feel free to let me know what you would like to do during this time. Tertius is still well rested and has options at the moment for what his current goals might be. Feel free to perform these actions in pm - and we can bleed information when needed. After we know what happens during this time we can progress to everyone being involved.

### Tertius
After patching up Servius and Tacitus, Tertius approaches Dezner with his medkit. "I've done the best I can for them at the moment. I've given them some sedatives so they should be able to rest at least." He begins to tend Dezner's wounds though Tertius is obviously agitated. "Now I'd like to know what in the God Emperor's Imperium happened back there? There were bodies literally everywhere! I want a full explanation."

### Tactius
ZZzZzzzZzzzZzzzZzzz

### Tertius
Tertius continues to bandage up Dezner's wounds while listening though perhaps not as gently as possible. "Well having this Spider Bride character in our debt is some small consolation, but now we have no way into tomorrow's party. On top of that the three of you are so heavily wounded that just getting you out in the field again will be an accomplishment let alone completing our mission."

Tertius' tone and body language begin to show his feelings of indignance. "Honestly, I am quite put out by all of this. I knew something was amiss with that package and I warned you to be cautious. I even called back later out of a sense that something was wrong. With Tacitus wounded and the whole place coming down upon your heads I can't believe it was decided that looting would be the best way to aid us in completing our task! I can't believe that Tacitus would give his assent to such an ill conceived plot but the proof is in the pudding as they say." Pointing to the two collapsed acolytes.

Finishing with his work, Tertius rummages through his medkit. "Here." He says will tossing some pills into Dezner's lap. "Sedatives. You should rest as well. I'm sorry to be so sullen. It's hardly your fault really. Servius and Tacitus are experienced Throne agents. How they could have abandoned their senses and their priorities for a little ill gotten gain is lamentable. I'm sure you were just following their orders."

### Tactius
Tacitus stirs in his sleep, "uhhhhh...ahuhhzzZzzZZzZzzzz"

### Tertius
"No Dezner. It's kind of you to try to cover for them but the decisions that were made in that casino were foolish. I've noted this type of reckless and self serving behavior from Servius before so I know what really took place. I'm just shocked that Tacitus gave in to Servius' negative influence at such a pivotal time. I mean to have words with the both of them when they have recovered sufficiently."

Tertius watches for some time as Septimus continues to try to assure Dulandra. His gaze goes to Tacitus as he say to Dezner, "There is something I must do." Crossing the room he comes alongside Tacitus and begins to rummage through the gear that is beside the battered man.

At last finding what he was searching for, Tertius walks purposely over to where the scholar and Dulandra are sitting. "Lady Melau. I feel it is time that we tell you the entirety of who we are and what it is we are doing here." Tertius reveals the Inquistorial Rosette in his hand and gently places it in front of the young woman. "We are agents of the Holy Ordos and we have been tasked with stopping the group behind the disappearances of so many, including your brother. We recently discovered that those with Haarlock blood were being targeted. When we met you today and learned of your connection to that line then I knew we must do our best to protect you. I must also confess that we crossed paths with your brother, but most unfortunately, we did not know who he was at the time and were unable to help him. There is a chance that he may still be alive but I fear the chance of that is unlikely. Please except my most humble apologies for our deception and our failure to help your brother."

### Servius
Servius starts to toss a bit in his unconsciousness. It seems that some dream or memory is disturbing his REM slumber. He proceeds to speak in his sleep like he's arguing with someone else, "No! Don't go in that room!! You two, stop!! We have to get off this Damn ghost ship now!! Great, now look what you've done!!" After saying that he settles and slips back deeper into the unconsciousness...

"That damn psyker..." 

A few minutes later, Servius stirs once more. His mumbles become audible again like he's quoting some mantra, "Too much lawlessness here...I serve the Emperor...protect His domain...judge and stand guard over His subjects...purse and punish those who trespass against His word...the law...must be...enforced...the law...I AM THE LAAWW!!...uh...uh...zzzz... With that, he slips back into the darkness again.

### GM

About 3 hours passes since the group has returned from the carnage. It is the late afternoon as Tacitus and Servius wake to sore muscles and stiff bones. First one eye and slowly the other, the two men look about the room for a minute letting the events sink in before pulling themselves up to a seated position. Septimus notices the rustling and carries in some water and bread to help regain your meager strength. Across the room at the small table is a woman you do not recognize reading a large volume. Questions- but they will have to be asked later. Not to be found in the room is Tertius and Dezner.

Tertius approaches Dezner following his discussion with Lady Melua. "I think that a vehicle would be greatly beneficial during our stay here on Quaddis. Do you agree? I would attempt to procure one myself but am lacking of funds." Dezner smirks at the request replying, "I might be willing to spare a few thrones but this might be more difficult that you anticipate. Our funds are meager and we have little in the way of collateral. However, I am willing to make the attempt." Tertius smiles, "That is all I can ask."

Turning to the other side of the room, Tertius goes to inform Septimus of his plan. "We are going to procure a vehicle if possible. I will leave this microbead with you in case you need to contact Dezner and I. Emperor protect you while we are away." "And you," Septimus replies with a sigh.

"Wait-" Dulandra, looks up from her book of Quaddis history. "I know where you might find a suitable arrangements actually. My family has a connection of sorts that provides services such as this. Let me give you the information." Lady Melua explains the directions to reach this concierge to Terius and Dezner before continuing, "Tell this that this is for the Melua family and that Dulandra is on Quaddis for the revel. Take this signet as verification if it becomes necessary."

Armed with this guidance, Tertius and Dezner set off.

About an hour passes before Servius and Tacitus come to their senses and awaken. After Septimus provides some basic nourishment they exchange exhausted looks of frustration for a moment as the previous days experiences wash over their memory. "Emperor curse you Servius. If you weren't already near death I would drive you to the edge myself." Tacitus threatens with the deep intonation of someone just awoken from a hard sleep. Servius sighs while inspecting his bright red burns, still throbbing with heat. "I will admit- things did not go as planned. Although we have been through worse than some underworld thugsâ€¦ Even if one of them did have their head removed in a very unusual fashion." With that thought Servius laughs and then stops as he realizes that any laughter is going to be painful.

After a few minutes Dulandra puts down the tome and approaches the wounded, "I do not expect any formality in a situation such as this. But I do feel it is appropriate to introduce myself. I am Lady Dulandra Melua of Malfi. I have inadvertently found myself tangled with your holy investigation here on Quaddis. We will surely converse more later so I will leave you to rest." She crosses the room and resumes her slow yet steady research.

As night falls, Tertius and Dezner arrive at the home once again. "Ah you are both awake!" Tertius sighs in relief upon entering the room. "Dezner and I were successful in acquiring a convoy vehicle with the help of Lady Melua." Tertius crosses the room to return the family signet. "My deepest thanks my Lady." Dulandra nods and then smiles. "It was my honor."

Discussion over the days events occur in sporadic and tired bursts. Tertius, Septimus, and Dezner talk through a rotation to keep a watch through the night. They agree to leave the wounded to rest without responsibility as the next day will likely require all the strength they can muster. Tonight- sleep is difficult indeed.
