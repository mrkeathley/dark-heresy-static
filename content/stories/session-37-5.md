### Aleister
(anyone who would accept a telepathic message from Aleister hears in Aleister's voice) "Hey, Something is happening soon..., not sure what but its something."

Aleister stands straight up in his chair and says " Everyone, something is coming this way. Take cover!"

### Chance
Immediately alert, Chance searches his senses looking for any sign of danger. 

### Theta
Theta looks and listens, then rushes to the nearest window opening.

### Servius
Servius tenses up some and places both hands on the table as he looks around the room for anything out of what he considers normal.

### GM
Captain Duhamel bolts up from the table and runs out of the room, bellowing orders to the house guard as he goes. Within seconds 10 swordsmen rush into the room and take up defensive positions.

The Duc stands as well, angry look on his face. "What is the matter sir?"

### Aleister
Aleister is white in the face almost a cold sweat looking around frantically "Something is... something is.. I could have sworn something was happening or something was coming."

"I felt a presence"

"Theta, do you see anything?!"

### GM
Theta sees house guards rushing out onto the Chateau grounds, searching for intruders but nothing else.

In the waiting silence, unusual non-rhythmic bird song can be heard. "The Warby Gal evening song." Father Pascal says. "The nights have come." 

### Aleister
"Inquisitor Graves, Duc, I apologize for my outburst.  I hope I merely overreacted to what I felt"

### Theta
Theta shakes her head "no" in response to Aleister's inquiry. But stays looking out the window

### GM
The old woman known as the Cardinala speaks up, tone judgemental, "You bring the mutant into our midst Graves? And not just a mutant but a warp spawned witch?!"

She makes an aggressive hand gesture at Aleister, a warding against evil.

### Aleister
Aleister just lower his head, a bit embarrassed a bit hurt by what she said

### Graves
"Aleister, it is quite all right. Let us assess the situation and confirm if this sensation is a danger." Graves stands and nods at the Duc. "It is best to be cautious so give us a moment to confirm if there is any danger."

"Theta with me. Duc, we will be back shortly." Graves heads toward the door.

### Aleister
"Sir do you want me to come along or stay here?"

### GM
Graves is out of the room before Aleister has a chance to get an answer, Theta dutifully following behind. She retrieves her bolt carbine outside the entry to the dining hall, her Dusk Raptor descending on her shoulder from a hidden perch above.

The rest of you are left in the dining hall, surrounded by guards, the Cardinala glaring at Aleister. The room is tense, the gourmet meal now cold.

### Servius
Over the microbead, Servius broadcasts, "Something is going on with the kid. Inquistor, you and Theta need to get back and see what is happening." Servius takes a defensive stance by Aleister as he waits for the Inquistor to return. His arms are still lifted slightly in front of him.

### Chance
Chance requests status from Graves and Theta over comms

### Graves
The requests come in from Servius and Chance in quick succession. "Servius please assess Aleister. Is there a danger? We are on the roof currently attempting to locate the assailant. There is clearly a malefic force at play here that we must locate. Aleister's feeling appears to have been correct. Warn the Duc and the guests that we are at risk."

### Servius
Servius responds back, "Inquistor, we have a problem. The whole rest of the room wants to end Aliester. He is currently unconscious in the corner of the room. The rest of us are keeping the natives at bay - for the moment."
