The Acolytes have scored a great victory over the servants of Chaos and bested evil where it may be found. The extraordinary eclipse swiftly passes with the Widower’s bodily destruction and light once again shines on Xicarph, leaving the Acolytes amid the carnage of the great and good. It is not long before armed servitors manage to regain control of the manse from the Pilgrim’s grasp. Entering the Theater of Clocks the usher your group of wounded and weary from the estate. Outside, the rioting and violence in the city is quickly brought to heel.

Like waking from some strange dream- you all feel relief for completing your inquisitorial duty and a strong desire to reconnect with Inquisitor Graves and report your success to the Ordos Calixis. Stronger than both those desires is that for rest. Your group returns to the rented room of the late Lady Melua to sleep until the following day.

The next day the city is alive with gossip over what occurred at Gabriel Chase the prior night. From what you overhear- most of the information is wildly inaccurate and this will surely end is fanciful tales to be shared for years to come. Your group had not visited the Ashtear Starport during your visit- but you realize that it had not been operating as of late. You see numerous landing craft now going to and from the edge of the city. A mag-rail line leads from town outside of the crystal dome and into the starport which is bustling with activity.

With the high level activity it turns out to be a trivial task to purchase fare aboard a supply ship back to Scintilla and to your familiar Inquisitorial connections.

Your top priority upon arrival is to reconnect with the Ordos. Your return is greeted with surprise and intrigue with the extravagant tale of abduction and heresy. Inquisitor Graves as a man of few words states upon your return that to live or die in the Emperor’s service is the same- but he is always glad when servants of the Ordos are successful. After a period of time your group is released to rest until summoned.

Upon hearing of Dezner’s impact and integration into the Acolytes, he is taken through further questioning and interrogation. Eventually Grave’s enters the room stating that with the loss of Alaric and Siskon this cell of acolytes is weak and is desperate for an infusion of new blood. He then offers you an position with the Ordos Calixis- working as an arm of the Emperor.

### Servius

"Really? Well, thanks for looking out for my well-being in there. I was worried that it was going to turn out like the armory. Good thing I recall the notion to stop drop and roll that time around. Did you see where that fire granade came from? I'm assuming that's what started the fire.

Alaric was a psyker and I'm very leering of their kind, especially of rogue one's. Their near heresy flys in the face of the emperor's laws, something that I'm duty bound to enforce and the drive behind why I agree with the work of the Inquisitors. In the beginning of this rag-tag group, I felt that way about Alaric but, as we fought together he began to change my mind some. Then we went to Quaddis the first time for a mission and he wasn't able to control his abilities and near deafened us all. Then something happened to him on that ghost ship mission. He kept giving Tacitus an evil eye.

It is sad that he is no longer with us. May the Emperor forgive his soul for any transgressions he may have had.

I do have a question for you, Dezner; while I have you here. What behooved you to run in the secret entrance back at the Manson. That was poor tactical judgement. What if I decided to stay in the salon or not noticed you went in?"

### Tacitus
During the trip back from Quaddis, Tacitus is sullen and rather introspective. He never gives extended responses and keeps to his own thoughts. After such dramatic events it can take some time to fully process and this is visible on the faces of the squad.

Upon arrival on Scintilla and during the debriefing Tacitus explains the full details of his time on Quaddis. He turns in some of the more interesting items such as Karkalla's rosette and the keystone of the Steel Clock. He asks Inquisitor Graves if he knows the purpose of the keystone- but Grave's appears to know little more than the acolytes.

Following the debriefing he returns to his roots and visits the temple where he used to serve to spend time in prayer and fasting- thanking the God emperor for his deliverance and revelations. He then spends time with his mother and sister in the upper hives. There is talk swirling after his return about how different Tacitus has become. This sort of intrigue comes with the territory of being with the Inquisition and he simple ignores the drama his return causes.

Tacitus takes in Dezner, "I think the close call that you and Servius had probably served as a good reminder of caution and the purpose of the chain of command." Tacitus sighs, "It is our job to accomplish the mission. And as the leader, your successes reflect well upon all of us but the repercussions for failure fall to me. I may be noble-born Dezner, but I do not relish leadership. As it is, I find no lasting fault for your actions, all I ask is that you be wary of the corruption within each of us, the desire to stray, and that you cling ardently to the God-Emperor. I look forward to you plying your services in the name of the Imperium. Go, rest, pray. We will have much to do when we see our Inquisitor and it is not likely will have have much of a repose."
